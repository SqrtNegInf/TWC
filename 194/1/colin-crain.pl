#         You are given time in the format hh:mm with one missing digit.
# 
#         Write a script to find the highest digit between 0-9 that makes
#         it valid time.
# 
#         Example 1
#             Input: $time = '?5:00'
#             Output: 1
#     
#             Since 05:00 and 15:00 are valid time and no other digits can fit
#             in the missing place.
# 
#         Example 2
#             Input: $time = '?3:00'
#             Output: 2
# 
#         Example 3
#             Input: $time = '1?:00'
#             Output: 9
# 
#         Example 4
#             Input: $time = '2?:00'
#             Output: 3
# 
#         Example 5
#             Input: $time = '12:?5'
#             Output: 5
# 
#         Example 6
#             Input: $time =  '12:5?'
#             Output: 9
# 
#         method:
# 
#             there are only four positions that the missing digit can
#             occupy, and a total of only six cases to determine all
#             possible maximal digits.
# 
#                 1. in the leftmost position, the tens of hours, the
#                    maximal value is 1 — unless the second position is less
#                    than 4, in which case it is 2.
# 
#                 2. in the lesser hours place, the largest value is 9,
#                    with an exception when the larger position is 2, in
#                    which case it is 3.
# 
#                 3. in the larger minutes place the maximum value will
#                    always be 5.
# 
#                 4. in the smaller minutes the largest value is 9.
