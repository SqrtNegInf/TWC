#       Frequency Equalizer
#         Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
#         You are given a string made of alphabetic characters only, a-z.
# 
#         Write a script to determine whether removing only one
#         character can make the frequency of the remaining
#         characters the same.
# 
#         Example 1:
#             Input: $s = 'abbc'
#             Output: 1 since removing one alphabet 'b' will give us 'abc'
#                     where each alphabet frequency is the same.
# 
#         Example 2:
#             Input: $s = 'xyzyyxz'
#             Output: 1 since removing 'y' will give us 'xzyyxz'.
# 
#         Example 3:
#             Input: $s = 'xzxz'
#             Output: 0 since removing any one alphabet would not give us
#                     string with same frequency alphabet.
# 

#         method:
# 
#             Let's start this analysis with a definition of terms. What,
#             then, is being asked of us? We are looking for a frequency
#             distribution of latters that can be corrected by the removal
#             of one element to make a set with equal distribution.
# 
#             So we need a set of letters all occuring with a count of x,
#             and one letter with a count of y, where y is not equal to x.
# 
#             So two values for frequncies, one of which only has one
#             occurence. 
# 
#               --- 
# 
#             In every case it seems we will need to make a frequency
#             distibution of the letters, counting the occurences of the
#             values. From there there are a number of ways to proceed,
#             depending on the results. Our goal is to equalize the system
#             so that there is only one frequency remaining. 
# 
#             If there are only two frequencies, and if one of those
#             is for a single letter, we're in. Removal of that letter will
#             eliminate the category, which brings the total count to one
#             and a flat distribution. 
# 
#             But wait! There is another possibility. This is when there
#             are only two frequencies and this incidence of one is one
#             more than the other, say two of one value and three of
#             another. In this case removing one of the letters that there
#             are three of will equilise the distribution at the lower
#             value. So we'll need to take that possibilty into account as
#             well. 
# 
#             A third more exotic case is when there is only one category
#             to start, containing more than one member, and that frequency
#             is 1. In this situation the distribution is already equalized
#             among a set of unique elements, and removal of any single
#             letter changes the total count of the category but does not
#             affect the overall frequency — that there is only one of each
#             member within the multiset. There is still only one category:
#             items with a frequency of 1. One might consider this an
#             edge-case variant of the first scheme outlined above. 
# 
#             And that's it.  I suppose, there's a pathological corner-case
#             of the last scenario that should be considered, where there
#             is only one character in the string. There will only be one
#             frequency, and if the single element is removed there will
#             only be one frequency remainiing. This is the same as above,
#             however that frequency will be zero.
# 
#             Which brings us back to our quote for today:
# 
#             “It’s like, how much more black could this be? And the answer
#             is none — none more black.” — Nigel Tufnel
# 
#             I will go out on a limb here and declare a frequency of zero
#             does not satisfy the conditions, leaving out the debate as to
#             whether a frequency of zero is in fact a frequency, or rather
#             an absence. Zip. Nil. Void. None more black.
