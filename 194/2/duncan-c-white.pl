# Task 2: Frequency Equalizer
# 
# You are given a string made of alphabetic characters only, a-z.
# 
# Write a script to determine whether removing only one character can make
# the frequency of the remaining characters the same.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# Input: $s = 'abbc'
# Output: 1 since removing one alphabet 'b' will give us 'abc' where each alphabet frequency is the same.
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# Input: $s = 'xyzyyxz'
# Output: 1 since removing 'y' will give us 'xzyyxz'.
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# Input: $s = 'xzxz'
# Output: 0 since removing any one alphabet would not give us string with same frequency alphabet.
# 
# MY NOTES: sounds pretty easy.
# 
# GUEST LANGUAGE: As a bonus, I also had a go at translating ch-2.pl
# into C (look in the C directory for the translation)
