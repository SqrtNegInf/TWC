### Input and Output

### Implementation

# Putting the cart before the horse:  If all characters are equally
# distributed and we add one character:
# - an existing frequency gets incremented or
# - a new frequency of '1' appears.
# Thus we can arrive at an equal distribution by removing one character
# if:
# - There is only one frequency.
# - There is a single frequency of '1' and all other are equally
#   distributed.
# - There is a single frequency with a value of one above the equally
#   distributed rest.
# Regarding the empty string as equally distributed.
