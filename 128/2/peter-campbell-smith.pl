# Assume that all times are on the same day - ie trains do not travel across midnight

# Make a hash (%trains) with all events - ie arrival and departure times - as the keys.
# The value of each hash element is the change in platforms need, ie +1 for an arrival 
# and -1 for a departure.

# There could be two events happening at the same time, so the hash key needs to be suffixed
# with a unique number.  Also, it would be dangerous for a train to arrive in a platform at the same time
# as an earlier train leaves, so we need consider arrivals at a given time before departures and
# so the hash keys have to sort arrivals at a given time before departures.  So a typical hash key
# is 12:20-a3 (the 4th train arrives at 12:20) or 12:30-d6 (the 5th train departs at 12:30).
