# One way of solving this is to scan over the arrivals and departures,
# keeping a running count of platforms required, adding 1 for an arrival,
# and subtracting 1 for a departure. However, this requires the times
# to be sorted, and we are not given that the points are. Sorting would
# require Omega (N log N) time.
#
# Alternatively, we could put the times the trains are in the station
# in an interval tree, or a segment tree, and perform stabbing queries
# with each of the arrival points. But building either tree requires
# Omega (N log N) time.
#
# Instead, we will solve the problem in linear time, taking advantage
# there are only a fixed number of minutes in a day. We start with an
# array of 1440 (the number of minutes in a day) 0s. Then, for each
# train, we add 1 for each of the minutes the train stays at the station
# (if the departure time is before the arrival time, we assume the
# train is at the station during midnight, and use the appropriate minutes).
# If we have processed each train, we find the maximum in the array.
#
# This obviously only takes O (N) time.
#
# Assumptions:
#   - If train A departures at time X, while train B arrives at time X,
#     the cannot share the same platform.
#   - There is no minimum distance between trains; that is, if train A
#     leaves a platform at time X, train B can arrive at the platform
#     at time X + 1.
#   - No two trains can share a platform. Either the platforms are 
#     short, or the trains are long.
