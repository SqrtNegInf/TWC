#       Maximum Sub-Matrix
#         Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
#         You are given m x n binary matrix having 0 or 1.
# 
#         Write a script to find out maximum sub-matrix having only 0.
# 
#         Example 1:
#         Input : [ 1 0 0 0 1 0 ]
#                 [ 1 1 0 0 0 1 ]
#                 [ 1 0 0 0 0 0 ]
# 
#         Output: [ 0 0 0 ]
#                 [ 0 0 0 ]
#         Example 2:
#         Input : [ 0 0 1 1 ]
#                 [ 0 0 0 1 ]
#                 [ 0 0 1 0 ]
# 
#         Output: [ 0 0 ]
#                 [ 0 0 ]
#                 [ 0 0 ]

#         method: 
#         
#             kind of hard for a first task, I'd say. I mean, not actualy hard per se, but it 
#             took me a while to twig to the idea of comparing the row elements using a 
#             logical OR to encode searches over multiple rows. It's kind of abstract. Perhaps 
#             this is a well-known problem or something, but I have no intention of checking 
#             or doing any more research at all.
#             
#             Let's have at it.
#             
#             Searching a single row for a (figurative) string of 0s is not a complex task in itself. 
#             The trouble starts when you start to look at sub-matrices covering several rows.
#             
#             We could iterate through the matrix and check each position as potentially the upper-left
#             corner of a submatrix: we could look to the right for a contiuation of 0s and then down 
#             to figure out the other dimension at every new zero found. A little bookkeeping records the 
#             row and column counts, to be reproduced for output.
#             
#             I suppose that's the easy way, but it sounds like a *lot* of nested loops to me. 
#             
#             Alternatly we could do all of the searching of a given multidimension at once in a 
#             list-wise process, using a bitwise OR, and assemble summed lists for every continuous group 
#             of rows. 
#             
#             Say, for a 3x3 matrix, we'll have lists for rows 
#             
#             (1)
#             (1,2)
#             (1,2,3)
#             (2)
#             (2,3) and 
#             (3)
#             
#             If that pattern looks a bit familiar it's the trianglular numbers, right? Well the number 
#             of combinations total to the triangular numbers: (1,3,6,10,15,21), or n*(n+1)/2 .
