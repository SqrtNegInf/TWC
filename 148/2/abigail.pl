# Cardona Triplets are also subject of Project Euler, task 251
#

#
# While the challenge defines what a Cardano Triplet is, it doesn't
# define how to order them. Given triplets t1 = (a1, b1, c1) and
# t2 = (a2, b2, b3), how do we determine t1 <=> t2?
#
# Order them on (a1 + b1 + c1) <=> (a2 + b2 + c2)?
# Order them on  a1 <=> a2 || b1 <=> b2?
# Order them on  min (a1, b1, c1) <=> min (a2, b2, c2) (with ties
#     broken on the second smallest number)? (Since for each possible
#     a, there is a solution with b = 1, this may be boring).
# Some other order?
#
# We will pick the first one.
#

#
# With some manipulation, it can be show that
#
#  cbrt (a + b * sqrt (c)) + cbrt (a - b * sqrt (c)) == 1  <=>
#
#  8 * a^3 + 15 * a^2 + 6 * a - 27 * b^2 * c == 1
#
#  Take this modulo 3, and we get:
#
#  8 * a^3 + 15 * a^2 + 6 * a - 27 * b^2 * c === 1 mod 3,
#
# which, since 15, 6 and 27 are multiples of 3, and 8 === 2 mod 3,
# reduces to:
#
#  2 * a^3 === 1 mod 3  <=>  (multiply boths sides with 2):
#
#  4 * a^3 === 2 mod 3   =>
#
#  a === 2 mod 3
#
# So, we can generate the a's with 3 * k + 2, k >= 0.
#
# 27 * b^2 * c == 8 * a^3 + 15 * a^2 + 6 * a - 1
#              == 8 * (3 * k + 2)^3 + 15 * (3 * k + 2) ^ 2 + 6 * (3 * k + 2) - 1
#              == 216 * k^3 + 432 * k^2 + 288 * k +  64
#                           + 135 * k^2 + 180 * k +  60
#                                       +  18 * k +  12 - 1 
#              == 216 * k^3 + 567 * k^2 + 486 * k + 135
#              == 27 * (k + 1) ^ 2 * (8 * k + 5)             <=>
#
#      b^2 * c == (k + 1) ^ 2 * (8 * k + 5)
#
# Now, b = (k + 1), c = (8 * k + 5) gives a triple for a = 3 * k + 2,
# but that is not the only solution for a given a.
#
# *Each* divisor d1 of k + 1 (including 1 and k + 1) is a valid solution
# for b. Furthermore, for each divisor of d2 of 8 * k + 5, if d2 is a square
# sqrt (d2) is a solution for b. Finally, each product d1 * sqrt (d2)
# is a solution for b.
#
# If we know k and b, we can calculate c as:
#
#    c = (k + 1)^2 * (8 * k + 5) / b^2
#

#
# To know when we can stop generating triples, we keep the 5 best
# triples so far, updating them each time we find a better triple.
# Once 3 * k + 2 (= a) exceeds the sum of the fifth triple, we know
# we cannot find better.
#

#
# Note that while we generate and print the first 5 triplets, we 
# will NOT print them in order. This is not a requirement.
