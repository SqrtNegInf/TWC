#         Eban Numbers
#         Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
#         Write a script to generate all Eban Numbers <= 100.
# 
#         An Eban number is a number that has no letter ‘e’ in it when the
#         number is spelled in English (American or British).
# 
#         Example
# 
#             2, 4, 6, 30, 32 are the first 5 Eban numbers.
# 
#       method: 
#             I think we're finally jumped the shark on number theory,
#             landing with a splash right in the middle of natural language
#             programming.
# 
#             It's tempting to try and write a textual conversion routine to
#             "speak" all two-digit numbers. On the other hand, it's much
#             more sensible to use Neil Bower's excellent Lingua::EN::Numbers
#             to do the tricky part for us. It is:
#                 1. the right way to do it
#                 2. good practice in the right way to do it
# 
#             Addressing the first point: Natural Language Programming is
#             fraught with hairy little edge-cases that need to be
#             addressed, and so, keeping company with the CSV format and
#             Date and Time Manipulation code, it's wise to hand over such
#             processing to a dedicated library that's sole purpose is to
#             keep such stuff straight.
# 
#             Then again it wouldn't be too crazy to address every case.
#             It's easy to visually inspect them all. It is, after all,
#             only 99 numbers if we start from 1. Why 1? As for zero, well just look at
#             it. And all negative numbers contain the letter "e" in the
#             word "negative" so we don't even need to decide to only use
#             positive values. On the other hand there are an infinite
#             number of real values below 100, so we'll need to disallow
#             that unwholesome creed if we ever want to finish:
#             "thirty-four point six six six six six ..."
# 
#             Yea that's not going to work.
# 
#             We'll start with implementing the module and go from there.
