# This is sequence A005117 in the OEIS.
#
# I guess we could factorize each number and check for duplicate factors,
# and that might be the way to go if we wanted to determine whether a
# a really large number is square free.
#
# Or we could use a sieve -- again, useful when dealing with (a range of)
# large numbers.
#
# But we only need to determine square free numbers up to 500. Which
# means we only need to test whether such numbers aren't divisible by
# p^2, for prime p, such that p^2 < 500.
#
# 361 = 19^2 < 500 < 23^2 = 529
#
# So, we only need to check whether they aren't divisible by 8 numbers.
# (We could stop checking as soon as we find a square which divides the
#  number, but then we would not have a one-liner...)
#
#
# Of course, since this is just yet another "get the first N values
# from a sequence listed at the OEIS", we could just print out the
# expected numbers, and turn this into a glorified Hello, World program.
