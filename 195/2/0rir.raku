195-2: Most Frequent Even       Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar

Given a list of numbers, @list, find the most frequent even numbers in the
list. In case you get more than one even number then return the smallest
even integer. For all other case, return -1.

Example 1
Input: @list = (1,1,2,6,2)
Output: 2 as there are only 2 even numbers 2 and 6 and of those 2 appears the most.
Example 2
Input: @list = (1,3,5,7)
Output: -1 since no even numbers found in the list
Example 3
Input: @list = (6,4,4,6,1)
Output: 4 since there are only two even numbers 4 and 6. They both appears the equal number of times, so pick the smallest.
