#
# Task 2: Shortest Route
# Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
#
# You are given a list of bidirectional routes defining a network of nodes,
# as well as source and destination node numbers.
#
# Write a script to find the route from source to destination that passes
# through fewest nodes.
# Example 1:
#
# Input: @routes = ([1,2,6], [5,6,7])
#        $source = 1
#        $destination = 7
#
# Output: (1,2,6,7)
#
# Source (1) is part of route [1,2,6] so the journey looks like 1 -> 2 -> 6
# then jump to route [5,6,7] and takes the route 6 -> 7.
# So the final route is (1,2,6,7)
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: @routes = ([1,2,3], [4,5,6])
#        $source = 2
#        $destination = 5
#
# Output: -1
#
# Example 3:
#
# Input: @routes = ([1,2,3], [4,5,6], [3,8,9], [7,8])
#        $source = 1
#        $destination = 7
# Output: (1,2,3,8,7)
#
# Source (1) is part of route [1,2,3] so the journey looks like 1 -> 2 -> 3
# then jump to route [3,8,9] and takes the route 3 -> 8
# then jump to route [7,8] and takes the route 8 -> 7
# So the final route is (1,2,3,8,7)
