# This `classify+map(sort)` might be more efficient for very large elements count
# with roughly equal-sized even/odd partitions.
#
# Note that there is no need to expand the classifying expression
# (like `$_ %% 2 ?? 'even' !! 'odd'` or `<odd even>[$_ %% 2]`),
# because .classify is not coercing the keys into Str; Bool works just fine for classifying.
#
# We do have to add `if .so` in the `map`, because the input might have no evens or no odds.
