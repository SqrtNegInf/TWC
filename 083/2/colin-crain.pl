#         TASK #2 â€º Flip Array
#         Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
#             You are given an array @A of positive numbers.
# 
#             Write a script to flip the sign of some members of the given array
#             so that the sum of the all members is minimum non-negative.
# 
#             Given an array of positive elements, you have to flip the sign of
#             some of its elements such that the resultant sum of the elements
#             of array should be minimum non-negative(as close to zero as
#             possible). Return the minimum no. of elements whose sign needs to
#             be flipped such that the resultant sum is minimum non-negative.
# 
#             Example 1:
#                 Input: @A = (3, 10, 8)
#                 Output: 1
#             Explanation:
#                 Flipping the sign of just one element 10 gives 
#                 the result 1 i.e. (3) + (-10) + (8) = 1
#         
#             Example 2:
#                 Input: @A = (12, 2, 10)
#                 Output: 1
#             Explanation:
#                 Flipping the sign of just one element 12 gives 
#                 the result 0 i.e. (-12) + (2) + (10) = 0
#
#           method:
#                 this task is remarkably hairy. We are given not one but two
#                 minima to consider, first to land closest to zero, and
#                 secondarily to do this with a minimum of movement. I believe a
#                 careful reading of the text bears out this ordering.
# 
#                 Obviously one factor in play here is the sum of all the
#                 elements. However when the sign of one element is flipped,
#                 that now-negitive value is not only applied to the sum, but
#                 the positive value previously applied can no longer count as
#                 well, giving a 2-fold effect on the total.
# 
#                 The fact that the end goal of a sum of 0 is paramount makes
#                 the number of elements to be negated uncertain. If the goal
#                 cannot be completely achieved with a single flip, we will need
#                 to consider all other possibile combinations of flips before
#                 declaring that target to be impossible. This fact remains true
#                 as the goalposts are moved, so we will need to keep track of
#                 the smallest result calcuable from flipping a set number of
#                 digits as we go, along with how we obtained that result.
