#       I think the result here, of a new tool to find out all things
#       palindromic, is not really the most practical thing. However the
#       algorithm used to get there is quite interesting and novel.
# 
#       I say the algorithm is novel, and I mean it: its only a few years
#       old and represents a new data structure that solves the problem
#       with a remarkably efficient computational complxity.
# 
#       Consider it as two interwoven trees, one containing palidromic
#       segments and the other
