# You are given an array of integers, @ints.

# Write a script to find an integer in the given array that appeared 33% or
# more. If more than one found, return the smallest. If none found then return
# undef.
# Example 1
# 
# Input: @ints = (1,2,3,3,3,3,4,2)
# Output: 3
# 
# 1 appeared 1 times.
# 2 appeared 2 times.
# 3 appeared 4 times.
# 
# 3 appeared 50% (>33%) in the given array.
# 
# Example 2
# 
# Input: @ints = (1,1)
# Output: 1
# 
# 1 appeared 2 times.
# 
# 1 appeared 100% (>33%) in the given array.
# 
# Example 3
# 
# Input: @ints = (1,2,3)
# Output: 1
# 
# 1 appeared 1 times.
# 2 appeared 1 times.
# 3 appeared 1 times.
# 
# Since all three appeared 33.3% (>33%) in the given array.
# We pick the smallest of all.
