# Credit: After reading wambash's code, I changed from `or return Nil`
# to in-line the `.min.?key` using the `.?` trick, which I had not
# known worked on the -Inf that `.min` returns on an empty list.
# I also learned a `.nodemap` trick that, while I did not use it here,
# I know I will have use for in the future:
#   https://docs.raku.org/routine/nodemap
#       When applied to Associatives, it will act on the values
