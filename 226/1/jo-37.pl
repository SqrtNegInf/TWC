### Input and Output

say shuffle_string(@ARGV);


### Implementation

# Calling the given numbers "indices" and providing values that could be
# used as indices in the examples is probably a red herring.  What we
# have here is a list of numbers in the length of the string but no
# further restrictions.  We need to follow the numbers in ascending
# order and pick the respective character from the same position.
# Performing an index sort on the numbers and take the result as an
# array slice from the split string that is joined afterwards.

    my $s = shift;
    join '', (split //, $s)[sort {$_[$a] <=> $_[$b]} 0 .. $#_];
}
