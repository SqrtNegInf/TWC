# so the next step(s) must just use up the min more slowly.
# So, I am satisfied that the `always use .min in its entirety` must always yield the best result.
# If I am correct in that logic, then the looping version could be replaced
# with `@ns.grep(* != 0).unique.elems`, gaining efficiency while killing any clear linkage to the original task.
