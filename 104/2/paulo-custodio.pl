# TASK #2 › NIM Game
# Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
# Write a script to simulate the NIM Game.
#
# It is played between 2 players. For the purpose of this task, let assume you
# play against the machine.
#
# There are 3 simple rules to follow:
#
# a) You have 12 tokens
# b) Each player can pick 1, 2 or 3 tokens at a time
# c) The player who picks the last token wins the game

# A plays to win, B plays randomly, A wins 91% of the time
# If both play to win, the second player to play always wins

    my($T) = @_;
    return $T if $T <= 3;       # win the game
    return 1 if ($T % 4)==0;    # loose the game
    return 1 if ($T % 5)==0;    # win the game
    return 2 if ($T % 6)==0;    # win the game
    return 3 if ($T % 7)==0;    # win the game
    return 2 if ($T % 9)==0;    # win the game
    return 2 if ($T % 11)==0;   # win the game
    die $T;
