### Implementation

# This is just an simplistic brute-force implementation with a time
# complexity of O(N^2).  Though is very fast, it is very memory
# consuming.
sub max_xor_cartesian {
	my $l = long @_;
    # Take the maximum of all pairwise xor'ed numbers.
    ($l->dummy(0) ^ $l->dummy(1))->maxover->maxover->sclr;
}

# The memory footprint of the above implementation may be reduced
# drastically by using two nested loops, performing an XOR between two
# elements and comparing the result to the current found maximum.
# Implementing this in pure Perl slows it down remarkably, though.
sub max_xor_pure {
    my $max = 0;
    for my $i (0 .. $#_ - 1) {
        for my $k ($i + 1 .. $#_) {
            my $xor = $_[$i] ^ $_[$k];
            $max = $xor if $xor > $max;
        }
    }
    $max;
}

# There should be a way to find the maximum other than by processing all
# element pairs.
#
# To reduce the number of pair operations, we maintain a list of set
# pairs holding indices into the number list.
# At each step of the procedure, any member from the first set of a
# pair, when XORed with any member of the second set, will result in
# a maximum value over some bits, starting with the most significant.
#
# The starting list is a single pair of sets with the first set holding
# the indices to all elements having a higest significant bit set and
# the second with this bit unset.  The bit position is the higest where
# both sets are not empty.
#
# Given a list of set pairs, for each pair two new pairs are
# constructed, such that the XOR over the next bit becomes maximal.
# Only pairs with both sets not empty are considered.
# If there is such an nonempty pair, the bit position in the final
# result is one and the new constructes list of pairs is carried to the
# next bit position. Otherwise the final result has a zero at this bit
# position and the original list of set pairs remains unaltered.
#
# As all sets in any list of set pairs are pairwise disjoint,
# the complexity of this algorithm is O(N * K) with N as the number of
# elements and K as the number of significant bits over all numbers.
# For constant K this would be O(N).
#
# For smaller lists, the full scan is much faster than this procedure.
# However, with 32K elements the set based approach outruns the full
# scan, which already needs about 4GB for a list of this size.  Beyond
# that, the scan approach seems to follow the linear increase but has no
# competitors any longer.  See benchmark results below.
