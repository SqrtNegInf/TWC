#
# Third Highest
# =============
#
# You are given an array of integers.
#
# Write a script to find out the Third Highest if found otherwise return the maximum.
#
## Example 1
##
## Input: @array = (5,3,4)
## Output: 3
##
## First highest is 5. Second highest is 4. Third highest is 3.
#
## Example 2
##
## Input: @array = (5,6)
## Output: 6
##
## First highest is 6. Second highest is 5. Third highest is missing, so maximum is returned.
#
## Example 2
##
## Input: @array = (5,4,4,3)
## Output: 3
##
## First highest is 5. Second highest is 4. Third highest is 3.
