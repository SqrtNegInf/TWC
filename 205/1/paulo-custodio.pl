# Task 1: Third Highest
# Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
#
# You are given an array of integers.
#
# Write a script to find out the Third Highest if found otherwise return the maximum.
# Example 1
#
# Input: @array = (5,3,4)
# Output: 3
#
# First highest is 5. Second highest is 4. Third highest is 3.
#
# Example 2
#
# Input: @array = (5,6)
# Output: 6
#
# First highest is 6. Second highest is 5. Third highest is missing, so maximum is returned.
#
# Example 3
#
# Input: @array = (5,4,4,3)
# Output: 3
#
# First highest is 5. Second highest is 4. Third highest is 3.
