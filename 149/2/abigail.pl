#
# This sequence A287298 in the OEIS.
#
# It's worrysome that the OEIS only lists entries up to n = 22 (while
# skipping n = 21). 
#
# And if we look at the given Python program to generate the entries,
# we see it's very slow: it starts with the largest number in base b
# where all the digits are distinct, of which it takes the integer
# square root. This is m. We then square m, getting m2. If all the digits
# of m2 are different, we done. Else, we keep decrementing m by 1 and
# repeat the process till we have an m2 of which all the digits are
# different.
#
# This is *extremely slow* unless n is small.
#
# Therefore, we will not repeat this calculation. Instead, we will
# just use a loopup table, using the values from
# https://oeis.org/A287298/b287298.txt.
#
# This lookup table was created by ../data/preprocess:
#   - We fetch the values from https://oeis.org/A287298/b287298.txt,
#     and inject the value for base = 22
#   - We add values for bases 23, 24, and 25, derived from running the
#     OEIS supplied Python program for quite some time.
#   - We then use bc to translate the decimal numbers to the
#     appropriate base.
#   - For bases exceeding 16, bc doesn't use letters, but numbers;
#     we use a regexp to fix those.
