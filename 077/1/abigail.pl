# Exercise:
#     You are given a positive integer $N.
#     Write a script to find out all possible combination of Fibonacci
#     Numbers required to get $N on addition.
#
#     You are NOT allowed to repeat a number. Print 0 if none found.
#

#
# Note:
#    The "Print 0 if none found." is irrelevant. There is always at
#    least one way to write any positive integer as a sum of distinct
#    Fibonacci Numbers. (Zeckendorf's theorem states: "very positive
#    integer can be represented uniquely as the sum of one or more
#    distinct Fibonacci numbers in such a way that the sum does not
#    include any two consecutive Fibonacci numbers")

# skipping the first two numbers 0 and 1. 0 doesn't add anything, and
