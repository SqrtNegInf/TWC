# You are given a string, $str, made up of only alphabetic characters

# Write a script to return the greatest english letter in the given string.
# 
#     A letter is greatest if it occurs as lower and upper case. Also letter
#     ‘b’ is greater than ‘a’ if ‘b’ appears after ‘a’ in the English alphabet.
# 
# Example 1
# 
# Input: $str = 'PeRlwEeKLy'
# Output: L
# 
# There are two letters E and L that appears as lower and upper.
# The letter L appears after E, so the L is the greatest english letter.
# 
# Example 2
# 
# Input: $str = 'ChaLlenge'
# Output: L
# Example 3
# 
# Input: $str = 'The'
# Output: ''
