#       method:

#         jortsort is a flippant little routine that avoids sorting
#         operations by simply verifying whether a nominally sorted input
#         list is in fact sorted, so that if it not it can then be kicked
#         back to the user to be resorted until they get it right.

#         The point is to make the user sort the input, like they said they
#         would. We do, in fact, have all day. 
# 
#         The original implementation, in javascript, accomplished this
#         by... wait for it... sorting the array, and then interating
#         trough the sorted output to see whether the elements match
#         pairwise between the sorted and input versions.
# 
#         As such, it serves no purpose other than to annoy the user with a
#         snarky failure mode, having saved no effort whatsoever, and even
#         tossed away some additional work along the way traversing the
#         arrays to make the validation check. I mean, if you're going to
#         be annoying and useless you might as well go big.
# 
#         Ok, two can play at that game.
# 
#         As the "use", a term I use generously, of this function is solely
#         to let the user know of their failings in life as a human, we
#         empahasize this aspect of the functionality. We will improve on
#         the petty jortsort v1.0, and take the opportunity to return a
#         more explicit error message detailing more clearly why the user
#         should reevaluate their life choices.
# 
#         Further, as we value the wear-and-tear on our stuff — everyone
#         knows the electron flow gradually erodes our silicon wafers, as
#         the mighty river erodes the very bedrock beneath it — we will not
#         sort the array, but, iterating through it, check to make sure the
#         array is sorted instead. We only care if any out-of-order
#         elements are present, not what they actually are, nor what the
#         whole truth of the matter is is. Consequently we will know our
#         answer after finding only one item misplaced. As for the sorting
#         from the original spec, we will simply lie and say we did it the
#         hard way, and go get coffee instead.
# 
#         Also, in a coup de grâce, the abusively recursive tautology of
#         using a sort() function to eliminate a sort() function, so we can
#         then make the user select and use a sort() function of some sort
#         on their data, maximizes the petty snark angle over all other
#         considerations. With this in mind, even though we have quietly removed
#         the need to actually sort the data to see whether it is
#         sorted, we will make sure to implement our own model of a worst-case
#         sorting scenario, so that occasionally at seemingly random times
#         (because our model will in fact be random) we will make our
#         jortsort2() function take an extraordinarily long time to finish.
#         Internally, of course, we will allow our precious silicon to rest
#         up a bit and take a nap for a while. We owe a lot to those chips,
#         and should always take the opportunity to toss them a bone when
#         we can. A well-rested chip performs better. Again, everybody knows that.

#         Lastly, we will choose to return the exit status of the routine
#         rather than a more intuitive answer, say to the question: "Is it
#         sorted?". Why? Because it's easier for us, of course. Having
#         gotten this far in the explanation do we really need more reason?
#         But necessary or not, we even have a hastily worked-up rationalization.

#         Returning 0 on success is, quite simply, annoying if you don't
#         expect it. Sometimes this will catch-you-up even if you do know
#         what to look for; this inconsistency only furthers the goals of
#         this new jortsort2 initiative. A happy user is complacent and
#         confident, and so consequently makes mistakes owing to their dull
#         state of happy-go-lucky acceptance, a happy cog in a world that
#         just works. And we can't have that, can we?
