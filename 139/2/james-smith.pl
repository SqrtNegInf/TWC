## We know 2 isn't a long prime, and also we are
## only looking at odd numbers so we don't have
## to worry about the special case of 2.
##
## Starting at the 3 we loop through the odd numbers
## Looking to see if the number is composite {has
## at least 1 prime factor lower than $p}.
##
## Skip to next number if it is (line 2)
##
## If it has the long_prime property we add it
## to the list of long primes (line 3)
## We also add it to the primes list (line 4)
##
## We exit the loop when we have the appropriate
## number of long primes

## We use long division here to compute the reciprocal

## 2$D-2 long.
##
## This division is done in line 2.
##
## The 3rd line finds the shortest repeating sequence
## tied to the end of this string, and returns its
## length
