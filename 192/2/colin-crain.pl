#       Equal Distribution
#         Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
#         You are given a list of integers greater than or equal to zero,
#         @list.
# 
#         Write a script to distribute the number so that each members are
#         same. If you succeed then print the total moves otherwise print
#         -1.
# 
#         Please follow the rules (as suggested by Neils van Dijke
#         [2022-11-21 13:00]
# 
#         1) You can only move a value of '1' per move
#         2) You are only allowed to move a value of '1' to a direct
#            neighbor/adjacent cell
# 
#         Example 1:    
#             Input: @list = (1, 0, 5)
#             Output: 4
#     
#             Move #1: 1, 1, 4
#             (2nd cell gets 1 from the 3rd cell)
#     
#             Move #2: 1, 2, 3
#             (2nd cell gets 1 from the 3rd cell)
#     
#             Move #3: 2, 1, 3
#             (1st cell get 1 from the 2nd cell)
#     
#             Move #4: 2, 2, 2
#             (2nd cell gets 1 from the 3rd cell)
#     
#         Example 2:
#             Input: @list = (0, 2, 0)
#             Output: -1
#     
#             It is not possible to make each same.
# 
#         Example 3:   
#             Input: @list = (0, 3, 0)
#             Output: 2
#     
#             Move #1: 1, 2, 0
#             (1st cell gets 1 from the 2nd cell)
#     
#             Move #2: 1, 1, 1
#             (3rd cell gets 1 from the 2nd cell)

#             analysis:
# 
#             What a curious puzzle! essentailly a model of diffusion, we
#             wish to take an irregular field of data and progressively
#             smooth it until we obtain a continuous lowest-energy state.
#             Only instead of operating on all points simultaniously, we
#             make one ajustement at a time in discrete steps of one unit.
# 
#             In diffusion, differeneces between a local state and its
#             neighbors are distributed between the two, raising the value
#             of one and lowering the other. Should the values be the same
#             there is no reasonto change anything. With fields in real
#             space this is an application of the calculus, but here in our
#             simplified, stepwise model we don't need the complexity that
#             entails. Instead we need an algorithm that locates the next
#             best difference between two adjacent values and adjusts the
#             higher to the lower. Exactly what that means remains to be
#             determined. 

#             It seems the first thing to do is make sure a general
#             integral leveling is even possible. If the sum of all values
#             is not evenly divisible by the number of pockets there's no
#             point in continuing. If it is, then this is our target value.
# 
#             The rules do not expressly demand we do the leveling as
#             quickly as possible, so we'll worry about optimization after
#             we've come up with any way to accomplish our goal at all. And
#             again we are back to performing the best move over and over
#             until we get there.
# 
#             What would the best move be? It seems moving the maximal
#             value one position in the direction of the minimum would be a
#             good strategy. Let's implement that. WHat's the worst thing
#             that could possibly happen? 
# 
#         method:
#             
#             Starting small, we'll need functions to determine the minimum
#             and maximum values within the array, and the positions where
#             thay are located. This will involve iterating across the
#             array and keeping a running tally. In theory this looping
#             could be collected into a single combined function, but for
#             clarity we'll keep the actions clearly deliniated. The
#             maximum counts upward from negative infinity, the minimum
#             down from infinity. These tallies too could be started from
#             the value for the first index but I find the special string
#             for infinity underused and conceptually robust. So why not? 
# 
#             Next we will need a move action. Given a position to more
#             from and a position to move towards, this function will just
#             change the array in-place instead of returning and rewriting
#             the array variable. This too seems conceptually pure. Less
#             copying, just change the thing itself.
# 
#             Finally arriving at the meat of the matter, the solve
#             function takes the array and decides whether or not there is
#             a solution using modular division. After calculating an
#             initial minimum and maximum the process is handed to a loop,
#             moving one value at a time and recalculating the leftmost min
#             and max until the two values are equal.
# 
#             As it works out we don't actually need the target value after
#             all. A counter keeps track of the number of cycles through
#             the loop, counting the applications of the move function.
#             Because I found the movements fasinating, I left in a VERBOSE
#             switch to detail the individual moves as they are made. 
# 
#             Because the algortihm identifies the largest difference
#             between elements in the system and their relative placements,
#             and then moves to equalize the discrepancy from high to low
#             in the direction found, it should always terminate if an
#             equal state exists. Because it does not care about absolute
#             values, it works for any whole number input. As there is no
#             cause for backtracking, the resulting solution should use the
#             minimum number of moves.
