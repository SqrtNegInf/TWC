Task #2: Equal Distribution

    You are given a list of integers greater than or equal to zero, @list.

    Write a script to distribute the number so that each members are same. If
    you succeed then print the total moves otherwise print -1.

    Please follow the rules (as suggested by Neils van Dijke [2022-11-21 13:00]

    1) You can only move a value of '1' per move
    2) You are only allowed to move a value of '1' to a direct
    neighbor/adjacent cell
