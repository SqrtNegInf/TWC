# Challenge
#
# You are given m x n matrix of positive integers.
# 
# Write a script to print spiral matrix as list.
# 

#
# We solve this by keeping track of the boundaries (min_x, min_y, max_x,
# max_y) of the part of the matrix which still needs to be processed.
# Initially, min_x and min_y are 0, max_x is the index of the bottom row,
# and max_y is the index of the right most column.
#
# We then process the matrix side by side, first going east (top row), 
# south (left column), west (bottom row), then north (left row). After
# doing a side, we update the corresponding min/max value. That is,
# after doing the top row, we increment $min_x; right column, decrement
# $max_y; bottom row, decrement $max_x; left column, increment $min_y.
#
# We're done when $min_x > $max_x, or $min_y > $max_y.
#
