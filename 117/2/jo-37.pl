-examples
    run the examples from the challenge

    run some tests

-triangle=n
    build triangular graph having size n

-from=v_f
    use v_f as starting vertex

-to=v_t
    use v_t as ending vertex

edge ...
    specify the graph by its edges.  Each edge has the form
    'h-t-l' with 'h' as the head vertex, 't' as the tail vertex and
    'l' as the edge label.

    Example 1 may have these vertex assignments:

        a
       ⇙ ⇘
      b ⇒ c
     ⇙ ⇘ ⇙ ⇘
    d ⇒ e ⇒ f

    and it may be run as:

    $0 -from=a -to=f a-b-L a-c-R b-c-H b-d-L b-e-R c-e-L c-f-R d-e-H e-f-H

    or simply:

### Implementation

# For a highly regular graph as given in the task there is certainly a
# pattern in the solution that permits its straight construction.  As a
# lame excuse for not searching for such pattern, I'm going to solve a
# more general task.
# Considering a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with labeled edges.
# Then find all paths between a given start and end vertex and print the
# concatenated edge labels for every path.
#
# This easily earns the N=10-bonus.
#
# Having implemented the lazy solution, it provides the sequence of
# the count of possible paths for a given triangle size as:
# 2, 6, 22, 90, 394, 1806,...
# Consulting OEIS reveals this sequence as the "Large Schröder Numbers".
# See http://oeis.org/A006318 and
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schröder_number.  Not even thinking
# about generating the 17518619320890 paths for N=20.

# Find all paths in the given DAG starting in vertex $from and ending in
# vertex $to and collect the concatenated edges' labels.

        return $paths{$vertex} if $vertex eq $to;
        # For every outgoing edge append the edge's label to the label
        # sequence for all paths leading to the current vertex and then
        # append this list to the path list for the edge's tail vertex.
