# Challenge 124
#
# TASK #2 > Tug of War
# Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
# You are given a set of $n integers (n1, n2, n3, ….).
#
# Write a script to divide the set in two subsets of n/2 sizes each so that
# the difference of the sum of two subsets is the least. If $n is even then
# each subset must be of size $n/2 each. In case $n is odd then one subset
# must be ($n-1)/2 and other must be ($n+1)/2.
#
# Example
# Input:        Set = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100)
# Output:  Subset 1 = (30, 40, 60, 70, 80)
#          Subset 2 = (10, 20, 50, 90, 100)
#
# Input:        Set = (10, -15, 20, 30, -25, 0, 5, 40, -5)
#          Subset 1 = (30, 0, 5, -5)
#          Subset 2 = (10, -15, 20, -25, 40)
