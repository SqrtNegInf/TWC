# Required: You are given a set of $n integers (n1, n2, n3, â€¦.).

# Write a script to divide the set in two subsets of n/2 sizes each so that the difference 
# of the sum of two subsets is the least. If $n is even then each subset must be of size $n/2
# each. In case $n is odd then one subset must be ($n-1)/2 and other must be ($n+1)/2.

# Method:
# The aim is to find a subset of $n/2 (or ($n-1)/2) of the input numbers which sums as close as
# possible to half the sum of the input set (the 'target'). The remaining subset will then sum to 
# a value the same distance from the other side of the target.
