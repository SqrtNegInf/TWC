### Implementation

# This is known as the "balanced partition problem", a variant of the
# partition problem.  Both belong to the class of NP-hard problems.
# Finding proper solutions is therefore expensive in the general case.
# There are several algorithms for the partition problem, particularly:
# - The "largest differencing method" (a.k.a. Karmarkar-Karp algorithm).
#   This algorithm is capable of finding a very good approximation in a
#   short time.
# - The "complete largest differencing method" (a.k.a. Complete
#   Karmarkar-Karp algorithm).  This is an extension to LDM that
#   improves the (initial) approximation until the minimum is found.  This
#   can be extremely fast if there exists an exact partitioning and it
#   provides very good estimates when used as an "anytime algorithm".  See
#   results below.
# Both algorithms can be extended to approximate or solve the balanced
# partition problem, culminating in Stephan Mertens' "complete balanced
# largest differencing method", which is implemented here.  See the
# arXiv paper for details.
#
# Distinguishing between a "proper solution" that represents a global
# minimum and an "exact partitioning" where both subsets have equal
# sums.  Every exact partitioning is a proper solution.
#
# Here are some approximation results for N successive cubic numbers
# starting with 1000000 and limited to a maximum run time of 20 s.  If
# an approximation can be identified as a global minimum, it is marked
# as "proper".  Delta is the difference between the partitions' sums.

#
# In summary:
# - In many cases CBLDM is capable of finding an exact partitioning in a
#   short time.
# - Many approximated solutions are very good according to their
#   absolute delta, which does not leave much room for improvements.
#   (Actually, all shown CBLDM approximations for N <= 33 are proper.)
# - With the scan implementation, time-limited results and the time
#   needed to find an exact partitioning are pure chance due to the
#   shuffled list.
# - In general, trying to find proper solutions for larger lists doesn't
#   seem reasonable.
# - For longer lists the probability for an exact partitioning grows and
#   these may be found very quickly using CBLDM.
# - For longer lists a scan approximation becomes useless and the
#   strength of CBLDM emerges. For N=200,400,800,1600 the very first
#   result is already final. (Use -approx=0)
