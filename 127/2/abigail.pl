# "You are given a list of intervals".
#
# Uhm, what's the domain? Which dimension, and from which set are the
# the coordinates? N? Z? Q? R? C? Something else?
#
# The examples given have 1-d intervals, with positive integer coordinates,
# so we'll assume we only have positive integer coordinates, and our
# intervals are 1-d.
#
# "Write a script to find out if the current interval conflicts with
#  any of the previous intervals."
#
# This suggest we should output a true/false value. Or perhaps multiple.
# What is "the current interval"? The first one? The last one? 
# The examples aren't very useful, as it prints out some of the 
# intersection intervals, leaving out others.
#
# Did noone proofread the challenge?
#
# We'll just going to assume 1 should be printed if there is a pair of
# intervals which intersect, and 0 otherwise.
#

#
# The best solution would be to build an interval tree, which can be
# done in O (n log n) time, and for each of the intervals, check if
# it intersects with any of the others. The latter can be done in 
# O (log n) time for each interval, which would give an O (n log n)
# solution. However, we'll do the easy thing: just compare each pair
# of intervals, stopping as soon as we have an intersecting pair.
# Worst case there are no intersections, and we're doing O (n^2)
# comparisons (each of them can be done in O (1) time).
#

#
# Run as: perl ch-1.pl < input-file
#

#
# Return true if two intervals intersect, false otherwise.
