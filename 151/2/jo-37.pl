### Input and Output

say grand_raid(@ARGV);


### Implementation

# The grand raid must end at the last or second last house.  Otherwise
# there was another house left to be robbed.  Stepping backward by
# adding the valuables at the current house to the booties available
# from there.  The found booties at the first house make the grand raid.
sub grand_raid (@valuables) {
    my @booties;
    # For each house, add the valuables therein to the maximum booties
    # available from there.
    for (my $house = $#valuables; $house >= 0; $house--) {
        $booties[$house] = $valuables[$house] +
            max 0, @booties[$house + 2 .. $#booties];
    } 

    $booties[0];
