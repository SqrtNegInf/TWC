### Input and Output

# Not even thinking about trying to format the content of a list of array
# refs.
dd uniq_arr(map [split /,/], @ARGV);


### Implementation

# What could it mean: "remove duplicate arrayrefs from the given list"?
# From the example it is clear that not only references to the same
# array are meant to be removed, but references to "identical" arrays,
# too.  An array may contain virtually anything and hence a "duplicate
# arrayref" can only mean two references to arrays holding identical
# content, i.e. "deep copies" of each other.  Here the smartmatch
# operator comes handy: for array(-ref)s it checks if the left hand side
# is "contained" in the right hand side.  If both checks $x ~~ $y and $y
# ~~ $x are true, both arrays represent the same data, or in the sense
# of this task they are "duplicates".  Here we cannot find duplicates
# the usual way by the usage of hashes because this approach requires a
# unique strings representation.  So we acutually need to perform an
# expensive O(NÂ²) pairwise comparison.
sub uniq_arr (@arr) {
    for my $i (0 .. $#arr - 1) {
        # Skip already identified duplicates.
        next unless defined $arr[$i];
        for my $k ($i + 1 .. $#arr) {
            # Mark duplicates.
            undef $arr[$k] if $arr[$i] ~~ $arr[$k] && $arr[$k] ~~ $arr[$i];
        }
    }
    # Filter dups.
    grep defined, @arr;
}
