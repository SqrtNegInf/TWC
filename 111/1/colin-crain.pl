#       Search Matrix
#         Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
#         You are given 5x5 matrix filled with integers such that each row is
#         sorted from left to right and the first integer of each row is greater
#         than the last integer of the previous row.
# 
#         Write a script to find a given integer in the matrix using an
#         efficient search algorithm.
# 
#         Example
# 
#             Matrix: [  1,  2,  3,  5,  7 ]
#                     [  9, 11, 15, 19, 20 ]
#                     [ 23, 24, 25, 29, 31 ]
#                     [ 32, 33, 39, 40, 42 ]
#                     [ 45, 47, 48, 49, 50 ]
# 
#             Input:  35
#             Output: 0     since it is missing in the matrix
# 
#             Input:  39
#             Output: 1     as it exists in the matrix
# 
#         method: 
#             we have two nested, sorted datasets. We need to first locate the
#             correct row that the value may be located in, then search the row
#             iteslf to look for a matching element. "Efficiency" becomes a
#             somewhat difficult to interpret term when sorting a through 25
#             values, as literally any method is likely to be lightning fast.
#             The overhead for the conditionals in implementing a binary search,
#             for example, would probably add more operations than saved, over
#             time.
# 
#             As it's unclear exactly where the line of simplicity versus
#             optimized searching is going to fall, we're going to set up a
#             variety of methods and see what works best. As the task was quite
#             clear that we will be working with a set 5×5 matrix we will tune
#             especially for that, rather than a more general-purpose solution.
#             
#         solutions:
#             1. flatten the matrix and look inside. The first version used
#             `List::Util::any()` to look through the array because it sounded
#             fast and the docs promnised it would short-circuit as soon as it
#             found a match. The docs said because of this it could replace
#             `grep`. `grep` turned out to be significantly faster. Perl is a
#             well-tuned machine.
# 
#             2. move listwise through the rows until our value is below the
#             last element, starting from row 0. This method definitively
#             identifies the value as belonging within a specific row, which can
#             then be searched. As with the previous example, I started with
#             `any`, then sped things up significantly using `grep`. As there
#             are only 5 values, I tried unwinding the `grep` into a cascading
#             conditional, and got another 10% speed boost.
# 
#             3. I tried a very simple divide-and-conquer algorithm, starting at
#             the middle row and moving either up or down from there. I hit on
#             using the spaceship operator from `sort`, figuring it would be a
#             strong target for optimization. By summing the operations of
#             comparing the target value to the first and last elements of the
#             middle array, one of the 5 values {-2,-1,0,1,2} will be produced.
#             The 2 and -2 results mean the selected row is either completely
#             above or below the target value, and a 0 means the value is above
#             the lower bound and below the upper — the value is within the row.
#             Conveniently, the only way to produce a 1 or -1 value is to have a
#             match with either the upper or lower bound element, allowing us to
#             return true immediately as we don't need to know which. The
#             conditionals are aranged to fall through, and should they arrive
#             at the bottom there are only 3 possible remaining positions that
#             may match, and these are enumerated with their own conditionals.
# 
#             One problem was that should a value lie above one row but below
#             the next an oscellating state is set up where we move between
#             checking two rows as the position of the value lies between them.
#             We need an additional conditional to check for this.
# 
#             Despite stripping the control structures and computation to a
#             minimum I could not get this technique to overtake the simple
#             row-wise search.
# 
#             4. In a last effort to unseat the throne I came up with the
#             simplest way to divide the row search that I could, with the
#             smallest amount of extra code. This method starts at the third
#             row, then moves the seleted row either upwards or downwards from
#             there. The search within the row remains the same.
# 
#             Although this method will locate the correct row in an average
#             of 2.2 tries, an improvement of the 3 tried of the original, it
#             ends up running about 10% slower.
