#       Ordered Letters
#         Submitted by: E. Choroba
# 
#         Given a word, you can sort its letters alphabetically (case
#         insensitive). For example, “beekeeper” becomes “beeeeekpr” and
#         “dictionary” becomes “acdiinorty”.
# 
#         Write a script to find the longest English words that don’t change
#         when their letters are sorted.
# 
#         method:
#             the trick here is not to find an efficient sorting method for the words,
#             comparing pre and post, but rather to find an eficient manner
#             of determining whether a word is already sorted, as any word 
#             requiring any rearangement fails the test. 
#             
#             By starting at the front and comparing adjacent pairs of letters
#             using the `sort` comparison operators, we can avoid sorting the 
#             words entirely. If in any pair the right letter if lexicographically
#             smaller than the left, the word fails and me move to the next word 
#             immediately. 
#
#             The longest alphaliteral word I could find anywhere was "aegilops" at 8
#             letters, being an variant spelling of 'egilops'. The longest in
#             in any dictionary I had was 7 letters.
