Task 2: Matrix Score
Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar

You are given a m x n binary matrix i.e. having only 1 and 0.

You are allowed to make as many moves as you want to get the highest score.

|| A move can be either toggling each value in a row or column.

To get the score, convert the each row binary to dec and return the sum.
