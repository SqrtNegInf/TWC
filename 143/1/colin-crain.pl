#         You are given a string, $s, containing mathematical expression.
# 
#         Write a script to print the result of the mathematical
#         expression. To keep it simple, please only accept + - * ().
# 
#         Example 1:
# 
#             Input: $s = "10 + 20 - 5"
#             Output: 25
# 
#         Example 2:
# 
#             Input: $s = "(10 + 20 - 5) * 2"
#             Output: 50
# 
#         method:
#             Mathematical expressions are guided by the rules of precedence. Operations 
#             occur left=-to-right, with parenthetical sub-expressions evaluated first, 
#             then exponents,
#             then multiplication and division, then addition and subtraction. 
#             
#             The puzzle here, then, is one of getting the order right. The hard part, the 
#             way I see it, is implementing evaluating sub-expressions first, specifically 
#             nested sub-expressions. We need to select out the innermost nested pair of delimiters 
#             and produce a value, where the idea of innermost is initially unknown.
#             
#             The general approach that lends itself to problems where we want to perform an
#             action some unknown number of times to home in on a result is to use 
#             recursion.
