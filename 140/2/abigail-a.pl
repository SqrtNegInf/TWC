# This solution scans the multiplication table in order, only generating
# as many numbers are needed:
#
#  * Assume i <= j (else, just swap i and j)
#
#  * Create i pairs. Initialize each pair P_n as [n, 1], 1 <= n <= i.
#    Each pair corresponds to the column in the multiplication table.
#    Since the values in a column are sorted, we only need to keep
#    track of the highest element we haven't descarded yet.
#  * Store each pair in a heap, ordered on P_n [0] * P_n [1], such
#    that the pair with the smallest product is on top.
#  * Let c = 0; while c < k:
#        + Let Q be the pair on top of the heap.
#        + Q [1] = Q [1] >= j ? Q [i * j + 1] : Q [1] + 1   [*]
#        + Restore the heap
#  * If c == k, then the wanted number is product of the pair at
#    the top of the heap.
#
# [*] If Q [1] >= j, we have reached the bottom of the column, so the
#     answer we're seeking cannot be in this column. By setting Q [1]
#     to i * j + 1, it will be larger than the answer we're looking for,
#     and we'll never consult this column again.
#
#  Building the heap is O (i) (trivial in this case, as we can generate
#  the elements in a sorted way). Restoring the heap takes O (log (i)).
#  Hence, the total running time is O (i + k * log (i)), using O (i)
#  memory.
