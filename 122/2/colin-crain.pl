#       Basketball Points
#         Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
#         You are given a score $S.
# 
#         You can win basketball points e.g. 1 point, 2 points and 3 points.
# 
#         Write a script to find out the different ways you can score $S.
# 
#         Example
# 
#         Input: $S = 4
#         Output: 1 1 1 1
#                 1 1 2
#                 1 2 1
#                 1 3
#                 2 1 1
#                 2 2
#                 3 1
# 
#         Input: $S = 5
#         Output: 1 1 1 1 1
#                 1 1 1 2
#                 1 1 2 1
#                 1 1 3
#                 1 2 1 1
#                 1 2 2
#                 1 3 1
#                 2 1 1 1
#                 2 1 2
#                 2 2 1
#                 2 3
#                 3 1 1
#                 3 2
# 
#             method: 
#                 what we have here is an integer partition problem, of sorts,
#                 where we only allow the partitions the maximum value of 3. The
#                 way I thought up to do this, out on a walk, was to start with
#                 an empty list of lists, and add lists of partial partitions to
#                 it as long as the sum was less than the final score. We would
#                 work through this list, shifting off the next partial from one
#                 end, adding either a new 1, 2 or 3 to the end of it and if the
#                 new instance still summed less than the total, pushing it on
#                 the backside of the queue to come around again. If the sum
#                 came out exact, we have a parition and that list is moved over to 
#                 another list for solutions and not recycled.
# 
#                 The first time around I put in a clause, that a new number
#                 cannot be less than the last number placed: this avoids
#                 repetitions by keeping the new patterns ordered, and we wont
#                 get both [1, 2, 1, 2] and [2, 1, 2, 1].
# 
#                 After I got this up and running I realized that what was being
#                 requested in fact wanted these repetitions counted as separate
#                 variations. So be it; this only involved stripping out a
#                 single `grep` filtering the `@points` options, so at each
#                 juncture the full gamut of adding a new 1, 2 or 3 was
#                 considered.

say "$_->@*" for @parts;
