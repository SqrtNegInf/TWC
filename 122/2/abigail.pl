# $s [n] will contain the possible ways to get to a score of n - 2:
#
# $s [0] is empty, as there is no way to get to a score of -2
# $s [1] is empty, as there is no way to get to a score of -1
# $s [2] contains the empty string, as there is only one way to get
#        to a score of 0 (not scoring).
#
# To calculate $s [k], k > 2, we take the union of:
#
# The scores from $s [k - 1], prepended by "1";
# the scores from $s [k - 2], prepended by "2";
# the scores from $s [k - 3], prepended by "3";

# A triple nested map will do the trick.
