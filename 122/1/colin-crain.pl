#       Average of Stream
#         Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
#         You are given a stream of numbers, @N.
# 
#         Write a script to print the average of the stream at every point.
# 
#         Example
#             Input: @N = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, ...)
#             Output:      10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, ...
#     
#                 Average of first number is 10.
#                 Average of first 2 numbers (10+20)/2 = 15
#                 Average of first 3 numbers (10+20+30)/3 = 20
#                 Average of first 4 numbers (10+20+30+40)/4 = 25 and so on.
#
#         method:
#             Rather than maintain a separate count of the values summed to
#             create an average, we already have this value as we're always
#             counting elements fron the first index. 
# 
#             By calling `each` on the `@stream` array we get tuples of index
#             and value for each element. We establish a running `$sum` value
#             that is kept up-to-date with even new element, dividing this by
#             `$idx`, which always contains one less than the number of elements
#             summed will give us an average value of everything seen up to that
#             point from index 0.
