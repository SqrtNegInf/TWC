#   Write a script to check if $C is created by interleave $A and $B.

# $A, $B, $C are arrays, containing the single characters of
# the input strings. $ai, $bi, $ci are indices into the arrays
# (and can be seen as pointers into the strings). 
#
# Invariants:  - $ai + $bi == $ci
#              - @$C [0 .. $ci - 1] is an interleaving of

        # part of C matches the first character of the unmatched 
        # part of either A or B, we match the first character of C
        # and the first character of either A or B, and recurse.
        # If the first character of the unmatched part of C matches
        # the first character of unmatched parts of both A and B,
        # we first recurse first by matching against A, and if this
        # doesn't provide a match, we recurse by matching against B.
