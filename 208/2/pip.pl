# Task2: Duplicate and Missing:  Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar;  You are given an array of integers in sequence with one missing and one duplicate.
#   Write a script to find the duplicate and missing integer in the given array. Return -1 if none found.
#     For the sake of this task, let us assume the array contains no more than one duplicate and missing.
# Example1:
#   In-put: @nums = (1,2,2,4)
#   Output: (2,3)
#     Duplicate is 2 and Missing is 3.
# Example2:
#   In-put: @nums = (1,2,3,4)
#   Output: -1
#     No duplicate and missing found.
# Example3:
#   In-put: @nums = (1,2,3,3)
#   Output: (3,4)
#     Duplicate is 3 and Missing is 4.
# Last date to submit the solution 23:59 (UK Time) Sunday 19th March 2023.
