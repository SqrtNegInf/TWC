# Challenge 208
#
# Task 2: Duplicate and Missing
# Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
#
# You are given an array of integers in sequence with one missing and one duplicate.
#
# Write a script to find the duplicate and missing integer in the given array.
# Return -1 if none found.
#
# For the sake of this task, let us assume the array contains no more than one
# duplicate and missing.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: @nums = (1,2,2,4)
# Output: (2,3)
#
# Duplicate is 2 and Missing is 3.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: @nums = (1,2,3,4)
# Output: -1
#
# No duplicate and missing found.
#
# Example 3:
#
# Input: @nums = (1,2,3,3)
# Output: (3,4)
#
# Duplicate is 3 and Missing is 4.
