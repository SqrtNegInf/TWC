### Input and Output

say max_words(@ARGV);


### Implementation

# From the definition of a sentence as "a list of words separated by
# single spaces without leading or trailing spaces" the number of words
# can easily derived as one more than the number of spaces.
sub max_words {
	1 + max map {(my $s = $_) =~ tr/ //d} @_;
}
