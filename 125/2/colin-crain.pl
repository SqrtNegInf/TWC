#       Binary Tree Diameter
#         Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
#         You are given binary tree as below:
# 
#                     1
#                    / \
#                   2   5
#                  / \ / \
#                 3  4 6  7
#                        / \
#                       8  10
#                      /
#                     9
# 
#         Write a script to find the diameter of the given binary tree.
# 
#         The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path
#         between any two nodes in a tree. It doesn’t have to pass through
#         the root.
# 
#         For the above given binary tree, possible diameters (6) are:
# 
#         3, 2, 1, 5, 7, 8, 9
# 
#         or
# 
#         4, 2, 1, 5, 7, 8, 9
# 
#         UPDATE (2021-08-10 17:00:00 BST): Jorg Sommrey corrected the
#         example. The length of a path is the number of its edges, not the
#         number of the vertices it connects. So the diameter should be 6,
#         not 7.
# 
#
#         method:
# 
#             You can tell the age of a tree from the number of rings it
#             has encircling its core.  The tree never stops growing, but
#             throughout the year it thrives in the summer, soaking up the
#             warmth and light of the sun to power its processes, puttin
#             gon weight for a barren winter to come, when it will berely
#             expand at all. The cycles, then, give the continual tree
#             growth its charateristic ring pattern, and serve as a commentary
#             on the world, rather than the tree itself. 

#             For this challenge we will bring out the set of binary tree
#             classes we built for PWC 113, and because crafting input can
#             be so difficult when constructing trees to a certain spec,
#             we'll add the tree print routine first crafted for PWC 057 to
#             help us, refactored and tightened yet again into a nice
#             self-contained package. Which, I suppose, is the next step
#             for the binary tree hardware. For now, though, as these are
#             demonstrations, I think it better to present everything
#             upfront, instead of hidden away in a module performing magic.
# 
#             The beauty of having a framework of course, is that extending
#             it can be quite simple, and we can focus our attention on
#             what we want done, and less so on how we go about doing that.
# 
#             I am again without internet, so, without any external
#             knowledge I was left to my own devices. I normally avoid
#             actully looking up the answers, preferring to let things bacg
#             around in my head for a few days should the problem be
#             present no obvious plan of attack, but in the senseless
#             pursuit of knowledge I usually allow myself the endless
#             rabbit hole that is WikiPedia, and here I don't even have
#             that.
# 
#             But no matter. The first thing that stood out was the comment
#             that the longest path need not go through the root node. Well
#             how would that present itself? In a highly asymmetrical tree,
#             the right side, for instance, might have many levels split
#             from the right child of the root, and the left child may have
#             few if any. In that case it is possible to traverse upwards
#             from the left child of the right side, up to the right root
#             child node, and then back down the right side to make the
#             longest traversal.
# 
#             On the other hand, it becomes apparent that although the top
#             node need not be the root, the longest traversal will always
#             have a fundimental vee-shape, up from a left leaf to an apex
#             node and down again to some right leaf at the furthest
#             extant. Doing a depth-first traversal is something we know
#             how to do. The question, then, is which node is our apex?
# 
#             We could try them all, which would be a bit wasteful, as we
#             traversed again and again over the same leaves computing the
#             longest path each way for each node.
# 
#             On the other hand, we could take a page from dynamic
#             programming and start at the leaves, computing the longest
#             partial path from each node to the bottom and work our way
#             upwards through the tree.
# 
#             The dynamic part is that at each node we set up a place to
#             put two values, say a little array, that holds the maximum
#             traversal down the left child path, and the complement vaalue
#             for the right. Then, when iterating recursively through the
#             tree, at the end of the recursive step we return the larger
#             of the two values, plus 1 for the path connecting to the
#             parent. The parent then inserts this return value into its
#             child-disance-log-thingy in the left or right position as
#             warranted. In this way if we do a depth-first LRN traversal
#             recursively, when the recursions collapse upwards they will
#             build out the child data for each node as the recursions
#             return.
# 
#             The diameter of the tree at each node is the sum of these two
#             values, the left child distance plus the right. By adding a
#             package variable to the tree object, at each step once the
#             child values have been filled in we can compare the diameter
#             at that node to the tree value, and update that if necessary
#             to reflect the maximum diameter.
# 
#             Implementing this involved adding a child_counts attribute to
#             the Node object, and diameter attribute to the Btree object.
#             A method, get_diameter(), does the depth-first LRN traversal
#             as described above.
# 
#             For the framework, and the additional print_tree() routine,
#             I've moved all of the helper routines into their wrappers,
#             encapsulating everything each method needs to do its thing. I
#             think this has a cleaner feel to it.
# 
#             The print_tree() routine is included to facilitate
#             manipulating the input data list. As the values don't matter
#             to this challenge, I've used the number of its level as the
#             value for each node in the demonstration.
