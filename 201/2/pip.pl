# Penny Piles: You are given an integer, $n > 0.
#   Write a script to determine the number of ways of putting $n pennies in a row of piles of ascending heights from left to right.
# Example1:
#   In-put: $n = 5
#   Output:      7  Since $n=5, there are 7 ways of stacking 5 pennies in ascending piles:
#   1 1 1 1 1
#   1 1 1 2
#   1 2 2
#   1 1 3
#   2 3
#   1 4
#   5
# Last date to submit the solution 23:59 (UK Time) Sunday 29th January 2023.
