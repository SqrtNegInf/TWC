You are give an array of integers, @ints.

Write a script to sort the integers in ascending order by the number of 1 bits in their binary representation. In case more than one integers have the same number of 1 bits then sort them in ascending order.
Example 1

Input: @ints = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)
Output: (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 3, 5, 6, 7)

0 = 0 one bits
1 = 1 one bits
2 = 1 one bits
4 = 1 one bits
8 = 1 one bits
3 = 2 one bits
5 = 2 one bits
6 = 2 one bits
7 = 3 one bits

Example 2

Input: @ints = (1024, 512, 256, 128, 64)
Output: (64, 128, 256, 512, 1024)

All integers in the given array have one 1-bits, so just sort them in ascending order.

is(sort_by_1_bits(1024, 512, 256, 128, 64), [64, 128, 256, 512, 1024], 'Example 2');
