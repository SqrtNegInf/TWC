#         TASK #2 â€º Jump Game
#         Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
#             You are given an array of positive numbers @N, where
#             value at each index determines how far you are allowed
#             to jump further.

#             Write a script to decide if you can jump to the last
#             index. Print 1 if you are able to reach the last index
#             otherwise 0.
#
#         Example 1:
#             Input: @N = (1, 2, 1, 2)
#             Output: 1
#
#             as we jump one place from index 0 and then twoe places
#             from index 1 to reach the last index.
#
#         Example 2:
#             Input: @N = (2,1,1,0,2)
#             Output: 0
#
#             it is impossible to reach the last index. as we jump two
#             places from index 0 to reach index 2, followed by one
#             place jump from index 2 to reach the index 3. once you
#             reached the index 3, you can't go any further because
#             you can only jump 0 position further.
#
#         method:
#
#             a silly little game, but we'll need to establish some
#             groundrules. First, do we need to land exactly on the
#             last element or can we overshoot? Should we wait and see
#             if Mohammad goes back and clarifies this before solving?
#             I think from the language it implies we should be
#             jumping _to_ the last index _exactly_. So if we
#             overshoot, then there's no way to get back and we fail.
#
#             If that's the case then there are two ways to fail: to
#             either land on a zero and be unable to continue, or to
#             overshoot the mark.
#
#             I would also point out that 0 is not positive, but is
#             used in an example. Thus we will rephrase the input as
#             an "array of non-negative numbers" which will include
#             the number 0.
#
#             So we keep tabs on an index value, advancing it by the
#             value of the array at that index. If that value is
#             either 0 or undef, then we fail.
#
#             If the index is the end of the array we win and stop
#             there.
#
#             Continue until we win or lose.
#
#             I like the idea of allowing negative values to move
#             backwards. In this case the failure modes would be the
#             same, with the addition of a third: if we ever visited
#             an element twice it would indicate we have entered a
#             loop, and will repeat without reaching the end. A little
#             more complicated in the possible pathways but still will
#             always resolve sooner or later.
