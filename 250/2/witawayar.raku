#`{
- Make use of the implicit signature feature with the @^ twigil
    - A signature `-> @alpha-num-strs` is automatically generated under the hood
    - So we have a function accepting a single positional Positional argument :)

- We need to traverse this array and check if it's full of digits, or not
    - Traversal is with our good friend `.map` as usual
    - Checking digits is easy via the premade character class `<digit>`
    - Full-match is ensured with the regex via the `^` and `$` anchors
    - Noting that to disallow negative-number strings, e.g., `"-12"`, `+$_` route is dismissed

- The match was successfull?? Then map to numberified version. It wasn't!! Then take the string length.
    - It's a bit sad that ?? (blunder in chess) corresponds to success and !! (extraordinary move)
      corresponds to failure but what can you do...

- The `.max` method concludes the challenge
