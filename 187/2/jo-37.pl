### Implementation

# Demystifying the task: There is no magic in triples satisfying the
# given inequalities.  These are just edges that form a non-degenerated
# triangle.  The task may be formulated as finding the triangle having a
# maximum perimeter from a given set of edges.
# Note: There is no triangle in any sequence growing at least like a
# Fibonacci sequence.
sub mp_triangle {
    # Sort descending.
	my @e = sort {$b <=> $a} @_;
    while () {
        # There is no triangle, if there is no smallest edge having
        # a positive length.
        return () unless ($e[2] // 0) > 0;
        # If the largest three numbers form a triangle, it has a maximum
        # perimeter.
        return @e[0, 1, 2] if $e[0] < $e[1] + $e[2];
        # If the largest three edges do not form a triangle then there
        # is no triangle including the largest edge at all.  Drop it.
        shift @e;
    }
