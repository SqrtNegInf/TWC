# Two friends, Foo and Bar have been on holiday separately to the same city. You are given their schedule 
# ie start date and end date. The date is in the form DD-MM and all dates belong to the same calendar year 
# ie between 01-01 and 31-12. Also the year is non-leap year and both dates are inclusive.
# Write a script to find out how many days they spent together in the city, if at all.
