# Task 1: Days Together
# 
# Two friends, Foo and Bar gone on holidays seperately to the same city. You
# are given their schedule i.e. start date and end date.
# 
# To keep the task simple, the date is in the form DD-MM and all dates
# belong to the same calendar year i.e. between 01-01 and 31-12. Also the
# year is non-leap year and both dates are inclusive.
# 
# Write a script to find out for the given schedule, how many days they
# spent together in the city, if at all.
# 
# Example 1
# 
# Input: Foo => SD: '12-01' ED: '20-01'
#        Bar => SD: '15-01' ED: '18-01'
# 
# Output: 4 days
# 
# Example 2
# 
# Input: Foo => SD: '02-03' ED: '12-03'
#        Bar => SD: '13-03' ED: '14-03'
# 
# Output: 0 day
# 
# Example 3
# 
# Input: Foo => SD: '02-03' ED: '12-03'
#        Bar => SD: '11-03' ED: '15-03'
# 
# Output: 2 days
# 
# Example 4
# 
# Input: Foo => SD: '30-03' ED: '05-04'
#        Bar => SD: '28-03' ED: '02-04'
# 
# Output: 4 days
# 
# MY NOTES: pretty easy.  Let's do it by hand (no Date modules to inc-date)
# given all the constraints, same year, non-leap year.
# 
# GUEST LANGUAGE: As a bonus, I also had a go at translating ch-1.pl
# into C (look in the C directory for that).
