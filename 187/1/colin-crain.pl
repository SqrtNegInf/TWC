#       Days Together
#         Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
#         Two friends, Foo and Bar gone on holidays seperately to the same
#         city. You are given their schedule i.e. start date and end date.
# 
#         To keep the task simple, the date is in the form DD-MM and all
#         dates belong to the same calendar year i.e. between 01-01 and
#         31-12. Also the year is non-leap year and both dates are
#         inclusive.
# 
#         Write a script to find out for the given schedule, how many days
#         they spent together in the city, if at all.
# 
#         Example 1
#             Input: Foo => SD: '12-01' ED: '20-01'
#                    Bar => SD: '15-01' ED: '18-01'   
#             Output: 4 days
# 
#         Example 2
#             Input: Foo => SD: '02-03' ED: '12-03'
#                    Bar => SD: '13-03' ED: '14-03'    
#             Output: 0 day
# 
#         Example 3
#             Input: Foo => SD: '02-03' ED: '12-03'
#                    Bar => SD: '11-03' ED: '15-03'   
#             Output: 2 days
# 
#         Example 4
#             Input: Foo => SD: '30-03' ED: '05-04'
#                    Bar => SD: '28-03' ED: '02-04'     
#             Output: 4 days

#       analysis
# 
#         Date and time manipulation code is notorously tricky, but with
#         the added constraints given this task becomes quite managable.
#         The devil, as they say, is in the details, and in the case of
#         date and time manipulations that would mean the myriad edge and
#         corner cases such as the occurrences of leap years, crossing year
#         boundarys or the sudden interjection of daylight savings time or
#         bank holidays.
# 
#         The first couple of examples I listed are relevant to the task at
#         hand and are excluded as special cases, allowing us to simplify
#         the problem as finding the intersection of two intervals.
# 
#       method
# 
#         month durations in days are fixed (in this simplification) yet
#         the pattern is irregular. We could use a lookup of months to
#         durations to directly count the days within each interval: the
#         end of the current month, the sum of any iterstitial months plus
#         the days of the end month. This would work but sounds tedious,
#         frankly.
# 
#         ALternatly we could use the same months to days lookup to
#         initially normalize the data in terms of days from the get-go,
#         and proceed from there with some strightforward arithmetic. In
#         this way we remove months from further calculations immedaitely.
#         This is consistent with our desired result, which will be a count
#         of days only, up to a theroretical 365 of them.
