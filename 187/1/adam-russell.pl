# Two friends, Foo and Bar gone on holidays seperately to the same city. You are given their schedule i.e. start date and end date.
# To keep the task simple, the date is in the form DD-MM and all dates belong to the same calendar year i.e. between 01-01 and 31-12. 
# Also the year is non-leap year and both dates are inclusive.
# Write a script to find out for the given schedule, how many days they spent together in the city, if at all.
