### Input and Output

}


### Implementation

# Generalizing the task to b-happy numbers in any base.
#
# Build a generator for b-happy numbers.
sub happy_gen ($base) {
    my %happy;
    generator {
        for (my $n = 1;; $n++) {
            # Return cached results.
            if (exists $happy{$n}) {
                yield $n if $happy{$n};
                next;
            }
            # Get the digit square sum sequence for $n in base $base up to
            # the first known happy or unhappy number.
            my $seen = dsss($n, $base, \%happy);
            # Is $n a b-happy number?
            my $happy = $seen->{1};
            # Cache the new found numbers as happy or unhappy.
            @happy{keys %$seen} = ($happy) x keys %$seen;
            
            yield $n if $happy;
        }
    }
}

# Build a digit square sum sequence for $n in base $base with cached
# results in the hash ref $happy
sub dsss ($n, $base, $happy) {
    my %seen;
    # Test and set $n as seen.
    while (!$seen{$n}++) {
        if (exists $happy->{$n}) {
            # Add one as hash key to signal that a b-happy number has
            # been found.
            $seen{1} = 1 if $happy->{$n};
            return \%seen;
        }
        # Get the next number as the digit square sum of the current
        # number.
        $n = vecreduce {$a + $b**2} 0, todigits $n, $base;
    }
