221-2: Arithmetic Subsequence      Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
Given an array of integers, @ints, find the length of the longest
Arithmetic Subsequence in the given array.

A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting
some or none elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

A subsquence is arithmetic if ints[i + 1] - ints[i] are all the same value
(for 0 <= i < ints.length - 1).

Example 1:
Input: @ints = (9, 4, 7, 2, 10)
Output: 3

The longest Arithmetic Subsequence (4, 7, 10) can be derived by deleting 9 and 2.
Example 2:
Input: @ints = (3, 6, 9, 12)
Output: 4

No need to remove any elements, it is already an Arithmetic Subsequence.
Example 3:
Input: @ints = (20, 1, 15, 3, 10, 5, 8)
Output: 4

The longest Arithmetic Subsequence (20, 15, 10, 5) can be derived by deleting 1, 3 and 8.
