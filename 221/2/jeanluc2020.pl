# Task 2: Arithmetic Subsequence
# ==============================
#
# You are given an array of integers, @ints.
#
# Write a script to find the length of the longest Arithmetic Subsequence in the given array.
#
##  A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or none elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
#
##  A subsquence is arithmetic if ints[i + 1] - ints[i] are all the same value (for 0 <= i < ints.length - 1).
#
#
## Example 1:
##
## Input: @ints = (9, 4, 7, 2, 10)
## Output: 3
##
## The longest Arithmetic Subsequence (4, 7, 10) can be derived by deleting 9 and 2.
#
## Example 2:
##
## Input: @ints = (3, 6, 9, 12)
## Output: 4
##
## No need to remove any elements, it is already an Arithmetic Subsequence.
#
## Example 3:
##
## Input: @ints = (20, 1, 15, 3, 10, 5, 8)
## Output: 4
##
## The longest Arithmetic Subsequence (20, 15, 10, 5) can be derived by deleting 1, 3 and 8.

# We find the longest arithmetic subsequence recursively. If
# the current array is arithmetic, we're done and have found
# the longest arithmetic subsequence. Otherwise we try in turn
# to find the longest arithmetic subsequence with each of the
# elements of the array removed. The longest of all these
# subsolutions is our final solution.
