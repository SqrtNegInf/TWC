# You are given an array of integers, @ints.  Write a script to find the
# length of the longest Arithmetic Subsequence in the given array.  A
# subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting
# some or none elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
# A subsequence is arithmetic if ints[i + 1] - ints[i] are all the same value
# (for 0 <= i < ints.length - 1).
