# Given a matrix M, check whether the matrix is in reduced row echelon form.
# 
# A matrix must have the following properties to be in reduced row echelon form:
# 
# 1. If a row does not consist entirely of zeros, then the first
#    nonzero number in the row is a 1. We call this the leading 1.
# 2. If there are any rows that consist entirely of zeros, then
#    they are grouped together at the bottom of the matrix.
# 3. In any two successive rows that do not consist entirely of zeros,
#    the leading 1 in the lower row occurs farther to the right than
#    the leading 1 in the higher row.
# 4. Each column that contains a leading 1 has zeros everywhere else
#    in that column.
# 
# For example:
# 
# [
#    [1,0,0,1],
#    [0,1,0,2],
#    [0,0,1,3]
# ]
# 
# The above matrix is in reduced row echelon form since the first nonzero
# number in each row is a 1, leading 1s in each successive row are farther to the
# right, and above and below each leading 1 there are only zeros.
#

# Example 1
# 
#     Input: $M = [
#                   [1, 1, 0],
#                   [0, 1, 0],
#                   [0, 0, 0]
#                 ]
#     Output: 0
# 
# Example 2
# 
#     Input: $M = [
#                   [0, 1,-2, 0, 1],
#                   [0, 0, 0, 1, 3],
#                   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
#                   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
#                 ]
#     Output: 1
# 
# Example 3
# 
#     Input: $M = [
#                   [1, 0, 0, 4],
#                   [0, 1, 0, 7],
#                   [0, 0, 1,-1]
#                 ]
#     Output: 1
# 
# Example 4
# 
#     Input: $M = [
#                   [0, 1,-2, 0, 1],
#                   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
#                   [0, 0, 0, 1, 3],
#                   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
#                 ]
#     Output: 0
# 
# Example 5
# 
#     Input: $M = [
#                   [0, 1, 0],
#                   [1, 0, 0],
#                   [0, 0, 0]
#                 ]

# Example 6

#     Input: $M = [
#                   [4, 0, 0, 0],
