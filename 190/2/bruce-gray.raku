    # 2. .map processes that list; inside the map $_ is a single Match object.
    # 3. That Match contains, via its .list "view",
    #    a Array of all the parenthsised captures,
    #    .[0] being the first set of lexical parens.
    # 4. `.[0]` accesses the first-and-only set of parens: (\d+)
    # 5. There was a `+` after that set of parens,
    #    so this next level is also an Array of Match objects,
    #    each of which is a cluster of one-or-more digits.
    #    We need each of those to be Numeric instead of Match.
    # 6. `.map` walks that innermost Array,
    #    stringifying the Match in $_ via `~`
