Task 2: Number Placement
Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar

You are given a list of numbers having just 0 and 1. You are also given placement count (>=1).

Write a script to find out if it is possible to replace 0 with 1 in the given list. The only
condition is that you can only replace when there is no 1 on either side. Print 1 if it is
possible otherwise 0.
