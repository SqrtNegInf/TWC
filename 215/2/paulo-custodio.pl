# Task 2: Number Placement
# Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
#
# You are given a list of numbers having just 0 and 1. You are also given
# placement count (>=1).
#
# Write a script to find out if it is possible to replace 0 with 1 in the
# given list. The only condition is that you can only replace when there
# is no 1 on either side. Print 1 if it is possible otherwise 0.
# Example 1:
#
# Input: @numbers = (1,0,0,0,1), $count = 1
# Output: 1
#
# You are asked to replace only one 0 as given count is 1.
# We can easily replace middle 0 in the list i.e. (1,0,1,0,1).
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: @numbers = (1,0,0,0,1), $count = 2
# Output: 0
#
# You are asked to replace two 0's as given count is 2.
# It is impossible to replace two 0's.
#
# Example 3:
#
# Input: @numbers = (1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1), $count = 3
# Output: 1
