# TASK #1 - String Chain
# Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
# You are given an array of strings.
#
# Write a script to find out if the given strings can be chained to form a
# circle. Print 1 if found otherwise 0.
#
# A string $S can be put before another string $T in circle if the last
# character of $S is same as first character of $T.
#
# Examples:
# Input: @S = ("abc", "dea", "cd")
# Output: 1 as we can form circle e.g. "abc", "cd", "dea".
#
# Input: @S = ("ade", "cbd", "fgh")
# Output: 0 as we can't form circle.
