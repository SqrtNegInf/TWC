# The challenge description doesn't make it clear whether we're
# looking for a cycle consisting of all strings, or whether
# any loop is sufficient. As is often the case, the examples aren't helpful,
# as they either contain cycles with all strings, or without any cycles.
#
# We will output 1 if there is *any* cycle. Including looping back to
# itself. So, if the input contains the word "eye", we will return 1.
#
# See https://abigail.github.io/HTML/Perl-Weekly-Challenge/week-115-1.html
# for details on how the algorithm in the module works.

    # line separated by white space.

    # We will create a (directed) graph from the strings in a
    # set; each string gives us an edge from the first letter
    # of the string to the last letter. (Hence, the nodes in
    # this graph are the first and last letters of the strings).
