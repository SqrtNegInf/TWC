# Task 1: "String Chain
# 
# You are given an array of strings.
# 
# Write a script to find out if the given strings can be chained to form
# a circle. Print 1 if found otherwise 0.
# 
# A string $S can be put before another string $T in circle if the last
# character of $S is same as first character of $T.
# 
# Examples:
# 
#   Input: @S = ("abc", "dea", "cd")
#   Output: 1 as we can form circle e.g. "abc", "cd", "dea".
# 
#   Input: @S = ("ade", "cbd", "fgh")
#   Output: 0 as we can't form circle.
# "
# 
# My notes: word chains are often quite hard. HOWEVER, this time it's a circular word chain
# using ALL the words, so that's much easier:
# 1. we don't have to try "what if we start with this word (for each word)", just pick one.
# 2. we must use every word.
# There's also (if needed) an obvious shortcut to speed up failure (0) case:
# fail if numwords(starting_with_a_letter) != numwords(ending_with_that_letter).
#
# (2) also implies an obvious shortcut to speed up failure (0) case:
# fail if numwords(starting_with_a_letter) != numwords(ending_with_that_letter).
# But I don't think I need implement that.
