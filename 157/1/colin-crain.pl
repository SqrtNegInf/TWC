#       Pythagorean Means
#         Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
#         You are given a set of integers.
# 
#         Write a script to compute all three Pythagorean Means 
#             i.e Arithmetic Mean, 
#                 Geometric Mean and 
#                 Harmonic Mean 
#         of the given set of integers. 
#         Please refer to wikipedia page for more informations.
# 
#         Example 1:
#         Input: @n = (1,3,5,6,9)
#         Output: AM = 4.8, GM = 3.8, HM = 2.8
#         CORRECTION [2022-03-21 16:35] GM = 3.9 (before)
# 
#         Example 2:
#         Input: @n = (2,4,6,8,10)
#         Output: AM = 6.0, GM = 5.2, HM = 4.4
#         Example 3:
#         Input: @n = (1,2,3,4,5)
#         Output: AM = 3.0, GM = 2.6, HM = 2.2

#         Pythagorean means in the manner of Pythagoras. 
#         Which was apparently that he was mean — a real bastard.
#         I mean, that's a sort of middle-of-the-road opinion on the subject. 
#         Whatever that means.
