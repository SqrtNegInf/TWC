# Task 1: Sequence Number
# 
# You are given list of strings in the format aa9999 i.e. first 2 characters
# can be anything 'a-z' followed by 4 digits '0-9'.
# Write a script to replace the first two characters with sequence starting
# with '00', '01', '02' etc.
# 
# Example 1
# 
# 	Input: @list = ( 'ab1234', 'cd5678', 'ef1342')
# 	Output: ('001234', '015678', '021342')
# 
# Example 2
# 
# 	Input: @list = ( 'pq1122', 'rs3334')
# 	Output: ('001122', '013334')
# 
# MY NOTES: nice and easy. Trivial in fact.
# 
# GUEST LANGUAGE: As a bonus, I also had a go at implementing ch-1.pl
# into C (look in the C directory for that).
