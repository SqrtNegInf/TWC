#       Damm Algorithm
#         Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
#         You are given a positive number, $n.
# 
#         Write a script to validate the given number against the included check digit.
# 
#         Please checkout the wikipedia page for information.
# 
#         Example 1
#             Input: $n = 5724
#             Output: 1 as it is valid number
# 
#         Example 2
#             Input: $n = 5727
#             Output: 0 as it is invalid number

#         Analysis:
# 
#             The selection of the correct quasigroup grid is required for
#             this particular error-checking technique to work, for
#             mathematical reasons known to Damm and left here as an
#             exercise to the reader. The actual use of the algorithm, once
#             we have this magic Sudoku square*, is remarkably
#             straightforward, and quite quick, which I would suppose is
#             the focus of its utility. To validiate a number with an
#             appended checkdigit, the number is processed digitwise
#             including the checkdigit. The process is replacing the
#             temporary value with the the new element from the grid, with
#             the row coordinate determined by the temporary variable,
#             starting at 0, and the column by the input digit, continuing
#             until the end of the number is reached.
# 
#             At the end of the process, the value of the intrim will have
#             returned to 0 if the check digit is correct. If the check
#             digit is not correct, the numeric string can be assumed to
#             have been corrupted.
# 
#             One interesting beauty of this process is that when the check
#             digit is computed it is affixed to the original value, and
#             decoding is performed exactly as encoding. Because the check
#             digit has been appended, and the values before the check
#             digit produce the check digit, the row and column
#             intersection will always fall along the major diagonal of the
#             grid, which we also know has been selected to be zeros.
# 
#             Thus the calculation including the check digit will always
#             yield 0.
