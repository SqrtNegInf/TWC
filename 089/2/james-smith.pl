### Now the bit below is another solution....

## This looks at all the rules and applies them sequentially
## You need to follow upwards

## We can generate all values if we only have a, b & e
## If we do this we get the sums of the 2nd and 3rd row as 3e & 30-3e respectively
## For these to both be 15 e must be 5.

## As e is 5 we only have to loop over a - $a and b - $_.

  ## Get magic square....
  map {
    $a = $_;
    ## Return square...

      [    $a + $_ -  5, -$_ + 10,  -$a +      10 ]
    ] }
    ## Now we filter a/b...
    grep { 20 >  2*$a +   $_ }      # f is a single digit
    grep { 10 <  2*$a +   $_ }      # ------- " ---------
