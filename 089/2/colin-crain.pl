#       TASK #2 â€º Magical Matrix
#
#         Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
#         Write a script to display matrix as below with numbers 1 - 9. Please
#         make sure numbers are used once.
#
#             [ a b c ]
#             [ d e f ]
#             [ g h i ]
#
#         So that it satisfies the following:
#
#             a + b + c = 15
#             d + e + f = 15
#             g + h + i = 15
#             a + d + g = 15
#             b + e + h = 15
#             c + f + i = 15
#             a + e + i = 15
#             c + e + g = 15
#
#
#         method:
#             Never much considered this particular age-old math problem before.
#             Not for any particular reason mind you, and I've spent countless
#             hours over the years on math puzzles.
#
#             One thing straight off the bat is the similarities to the sudoku
#             puzzle a few weeks back. I mean, obviously. So the basic mechanics
#             of guessing a cell seem a reasonable way to start:
#             using that data to constrain the possible
#             values of the remaining cells, then picking from available choices
#             for the next cell, continuing until either a contradiction is
#             reached or the last cell is filled.

#             Studying the square, it's apparent that not every cell is equal
#             per se. The center, for instance, is part of two orthogonal
#             and two diagonal lines, for a total of 4. The corners, on the
#             other hand, are contained within two orthogonals and only one
#             diagonal, for three lines, and the edges only affect two. So it
#             stands to reason that if we are going to take a constraining tree
#             appraoch then we should progress from the center, to the corners,
#             and then the edges, so our earlier choices have maximum effect.
#
#             Another consideration is the sum of each line. Once any two
#             numbers have been placed, the third is determined by the other two
#             and the required total.
#
#             Combining these two facts, any possible configuration can be
#             evaluated for magic behavior after choosing only three values: the
#             center, any corner, and either adjacent corner to that picked. The
#             center does not determine any cell configuration on its own, but
#             does constrain all 8 remaining cells surrounding it. The next, a
#             corner (they are all equivalent so it does not matter which we
#             pick) can be any value that is neither the center value nor a
#             value that would require its complement across the line to be a
#             number out-of-bounds. For example, with a center of 1, the top
#             left cannot be 2 because the lower right would need to be 12 to
#             sum to 15, which is not allowed. In this case the top left would
#             need to be a value of 5 or more.
#
#             Once one corner is chosen, this act will determine its opposing
#             corner. The final choice, of either adjacent corner, is any value
#             not already determined, nor, like the corner before, a number that
#             would require its opposite to be disallowed.
#
#             With the placement of the second corner all remaining edges are
#             constrained to be the difference between the target value and the
#             sum of the two placed cells. Once calculated, there will either be
#             a contradiction found or the result will be determined to be a
#             magic square. The contradictions will be either to require a value no
#             longer available, or invalid across the relevant center orthogonal.

#             ---

#             using this method, it didn't take me long at all to make the following
#             square in my head, on the third try:
#
#                 4  3  8
#                 9  5  1
#                 2  7  6
#
#             so that's nice. We know it's sound.
