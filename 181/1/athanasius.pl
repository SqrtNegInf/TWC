Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar

You are given a paragraph.

paragraph.

  Input:
      All he could think about was how it would all end. There was
      still a bit of uncertainty in the equation, but the basics
      were there for anyone to see. No matter how much he tried to
      see the positive, it wasn't anywhere to be seen. The end was
      coming and it wasn't going to be pretty.

  Output:
      about All all could end he how it think was would. a anyone
      basics bit but equation, for in of see still the the There
      there to uncertainty was were. anywhere be he how it matter
      much No positive, see seen the to to tried wasn't. and be

Assumptions
-----------
1. A *sentence* is a series of words ending in a full stop, a question mark, an
   exclamation mark, or the end of the paragraph.
2. Alphanumeric order places digits before letters, and upper case before lower
   case: e.g., aC1cB3b2A -> 123ABCabc.

Interface
---------
The paragraph to be reordered is entered on the command line. If no paragraph
is given, a test suite is run instead.
