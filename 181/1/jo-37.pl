### Input and Output

print order_sentences(do {local $/; <>});


### Implementation

# "Write a script to order each sentence alphanumerically and print the
# whole paragraph."  Certainly we just entered the realm of uncertainty.
# Making some observations (O) and assumptions (A):
# - (A) Take the whole given text as one "paragraph".
# - (O) Split the paragraph into "sentences" that are parts terminated
#   with a dot, optionally followed by whitespace.
# - (O) Sentences are made up by "words" separated by whitespace.
# - (A) An "ordered sentence" consists of the sentence's sorted
#   words.
# - (A) An "alphanumerical" string is a string consisting of
#   letters and digits only.
# - (A) An "alphanumeric order" is the order induced by reducing
#   the given strings to their alphanumeric characters.
# - (O) Sorting is case-insensitive, but:
# - (O) An uppercase letter comes before the same lowercase letter.
# - (O) Non-alphanumeric characters are preserved.


# Unwinding backwards:
# - split the paragraph into sentences
# - split a sentence into words
# - Schwartzian transform: Build pairs of the alphanumeric reduction of
#   a word and the word itself
# - Sort the words by their alphanumeric reduction - case insensitive
#   first, then upper before lower case
# - drop the alphanumeric reduction
# - join words
# - join sentences, append dot and newline

All he could think about was how it would all end. There was
still a bit of uncertainty in the equation, but the basics
were there for anyone to see. No matter how much he tried to
see the positive, it wasn't anywhere to be seen. The end was
coming and it wasn't going to be pretty.
