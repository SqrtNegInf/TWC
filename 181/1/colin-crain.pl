#       Sentence Order
#         Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
#         You are given a paragraph.
# 
#         Write a script to order each sentence alphanumerically and print
#         the whole paragraph.
# 
#         Example
#         Input:
#             All he could think about was how it would all end. There was
#             still a bit of uncertainty in the equation, but the basics
#             were there for anyone to see. No matter how much he tried to
#             see the positive, it wasn't anywhere to be seen. The end was
#             coming and it wasn't going to be pretty.
# 
#         Ouput:
#             about All all could end he how it think was would. a anyone
#             basics bit but equation, for in of see still the the There
#             there to uncertainty was were. anywhere be he how it matter
#             much No positive, see seen the to to tried wasn't. and be
#             coming end going it pretty The to was wasn't.

#       Background
# 
#         One of the biggest obsticles facing any new reader is that the
#         words, simply put, are all over the place. WE might start near
#         the front of the alphabet, then jump hapazardly to near the end,
#         then back to the front again followed by somewhere in the middle.
#         To a casual observer this placement could reasonably be
#         considered random. It's exhausting, both mentally and physically.
# 
#         Even thinking about this state of affairs has left me emotionally
#         drained and dangeously unstable. It cannot stand.
# 
#         So what can we do to make this reading thing more user-friendly?
# 
#         Well, one thing that comes to mind is we could minimize the
#         lettering gaps between adjacent words in a sentence. We start
#         with all the "A" words and end with "Zymurgy", sould we be
#         unlucky enough to have to travel that far. Then, for the next
#         sentence, the next idea, we simply take a casual walk back to the
#         begining of the alphabet, each at our own pace, taking as much
#         advantage as required given the broad latitude in pausing
#         delivered by the punctuation marks.
# 
#         That sounds *way* better. Let's do that.
# 

#       Method
# 
#         We'll need to split our paragraph up two ways: once to break out
#         the individual sentences, then again within the sentence to sort
#         the words. Using `split` on the input paragraph, we can define a
#         regular expression to match out the terminal punctuation: period,
#         question mark or exclamation point.
# 
#             /[.?!]/
# 
#         Rewmewmber that a dot inside a character class is just a dot, not
#         a wildcard.
# 
#         But, you ask, what of that word, "alphanumerically" in the
#         challenge description? This does imply the possible existence of
#         numbers, and with them decimal points. And decimal points do look
#         suspiciously like periods. This could cause a problem should we
#         need to define pi within our sentence.
# 
#         Fortunately punctuation that actually ends a sentence is
#         invariably followed by a space, so if we include that in our
#         delimiter we're good again.
# 
#             /[.?!]\s/
# 
#         However as-is our sentence splitting does not simply split on but
#         removes and discards the terminal punctuation! Holy crap! How did we miss that?
# 
#         Wait, wait, take a deep breath. If we surround the delimiter
#         match with capture parentheses, the matched delimiter is returned
#         as an element in the split array. Then, because every sentence
#         has some sort of terminal puncuation we end up with pairs of
#         snetences and their closing marks.
# 
#         There's only one loose end remaining, being the last line of the
#         input, which likely has a period without a space as there's
#         nothing to separate it from. There may not even be a terminal
#         linefeed. Fortuantely we have a metacharacter for that: the
#         anchor `$` signifying the end of the string.
# 
#         What we end up with is
# 
#             split /([.?!](?:\s|$))/, $input
# 
#         which does what we need. 
# 
#         The last piece of the puzzle is to rearrange the words in each
#         sentence irrespective of any capitalization. We need to isolate
#         the sentece element from rthe first array and split it again, on
#         simple whitespace this time and sort the array. To perform the
#         sort case-insensitive the normal way we used to do things would
#         be to convert to lower- or uppercase and use that as the basis,
#         but with the introduction of Unicode we have an improvement in
#         "casefolding", being an generalized way of comparing strings
#         regardeless to case, not matter the specific meaning in non-Latin
#         alphabets. Using `fc()` is a bit less hacky as the function is
#         designed specifically to perform case-insensitive comparisons.
