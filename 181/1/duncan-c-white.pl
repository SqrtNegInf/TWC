# Task 1: Sentence Order
# 
# You are given a paragraph.
# 
# Write a script to order each sentence alphanumerically and print the
# whole paragraph.
# 
# Example
# 
# Input:
#     All he could think about was how it would all end. There was
#     still a bit of uncertainty in the equation, but the basics
#     were there for anyone to see. No matter how much he tried to
#     see the positive, it wasn't anywhere to be seen. The end was
#     coming and it wasn't going to be pretty.
# 
# Output:
#     about All all could end he how it think was would. a anyone
#     basics bit but equation, for in of see still the the There
#     there to uncertainty was were. anywhere be he how it matter
#     much No positive, see seen the to to tried wasn't. and be
#     coming end going it pretty The to was wasn't.
# 
# MY NOTES: hmm, sounds surprisingly tricky, we have to read all the input,
# identify all the sentences (a sentence can span multiple lines), for each
# sentence split off the trailing '. ', sort the words in the sentence in
# case-insensitive order, add the '. ' back again, accumulate all the
# output words in a single array, and then print it out with width formatting.
# Stole width formatting code from challenge 177.
