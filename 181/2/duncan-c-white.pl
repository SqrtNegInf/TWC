# Task 2: Hot Day
# 
# You are given file with daily temperature record in random order.
# Write a script to find out days hotter than previous day.
# 
# Example
# 
# Input File: (temperature.txt)
# 
# 2022-08-01, 20
# 2022-08-09, 10
# 2022-08-03, 19
# 2022-08-06, 24
# 2022-08-05, 22
# 2022-08-10, 28
# 2022-08-07, 20
# 2022-08-04, 18
# 2022-08-08, 21
# 2022-08-02, 25
# 
# Output:
# 2022-08-02
# 2022-08-05
# 2022-08-06
# 2022-08-08
# 2022-08-10
# 
# MY NOTES: looks pretty easy (easier than first task).  Could parse dates, but
# technically as the dates are all ISO dates, they can be sorted as strings.
# 
# GUEST LANGUAGE: As a bonus, I also had a go at translating ch-2.pl
# into C (look in the C directory for that).
