-examples
    run the examples from the challenge

-tests
    run some tests

-start=pos
    use pos as the starting square for the knight. Default: a8

t1 ...
    positions of treasures on the board in chess notation (a1 ... h8)

Solving the example:
    $0 b1 a2 b2 b3 c4 e6
or simply:
    $0 -examples

Output is one line for each path from the starting square / previous
treasure square to the next treasure square.

### Implementation

# The task can be divided into four subtasks:
#
# 1) Build the knight's graph.  See
#    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_graph
#
# 2) Find the shortest paths between the start and all treasure squares
#    within the knight's graph and build a weighted "treasure graph" out
#    of it.  See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm
#
# 3) Solve the travelling salesman problem in the "treasure graph".  See
#    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem
#
# 4) Present the solution on the board.  This is probably the most
#    laborious part and has been left out here.

# Solve the task: subtasks 1) to 3).

# to consider the opposite directions by symmetry. Use "character
