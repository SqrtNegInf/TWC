#       Adventure of Knight
#         Submitted by: Cheok-Yin Fung
#         A knight is restricted to move on an 8×8 chessboard. The knight is
#         denoted by N and its way of movement is the same as what it is defined
#         in Chess. * represents an empty square. x represents a square with
#         treasure.
# 
#         The Knight’s movement is unique. It may move two squares vertically
#         and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one
#         square vertically (with both forming the shape of an L).
# 
#         There are 6 squares with treasures.
# 
#         Write a script to find the path such that Knight can capture all
#         treasures. The Knight can start from the top-left square.
#

# 
#       method:
#             just went of it and started writing functions. Read the board from
#             DATA, leaving xs and undefining stars. Established all 8 knight
#             moves as deltas, then a function that when given a square as a
#             tuple of coordinates returns positions the knight can move to
#             next. Then a recursive function to start trying paths. Ok, not all
#             paths as we don't allow going back to the square we just left
#             unless there's no other move, to avoid immediate loops. But what
#             about larger loops?
# 
#             Got the recursive solver sort of working, enough to figure out it
#             was rapidly falling into a 6-part cycle. If we were to keep a
#             lookup table for moves made from one square to the next, and
#             disallow, or at least avoid, repeating the last move made from a
#             given position that *might* work. But we're rather far afield now
#             and that might not be enough. It might also eliminate solutions;
#             it's hard to say and I don't like that. In the end we're just sort
#             of wandering around hoping to snatch up the treasures. It seems
#             less like our knight is off to slay a dragon and more like he's
#             driving aimlessly looking for America. In the fourth act he'll
#             discover it was with him the whole time.

#             I'm tempted to implement this no-repeating loop-breaker hash but I
#             think the strategy is doomed from the outset. I wonder what it
#             would look like? Do we exclude the last move or every move,
#             somehow? The idea is both intreaging and a total hack.
# 
#             Alternately we could take a more directed approach. We could
#             determine the closest treasure and home in on it, snatch it and
#             then move to the next. This would involve more familiarity with
#             the game of chess that I can just whip out of local memory. But I
#             suppose I could figure it out.
# 
#             I don't really do chess; never have. I know the rules, how to play, but
#             never pursued any deep understanding of the game. I suppose I'll just
#             need to make it up.

#             If we make a distance algorithm we can find which of the available
#             moves gets us closest to the target, then repeat. A little
#             analysis determines we can generally employ some stock patterns to
#             move one square diagonally, or orthogonally. This sounds like a
#             bother to configure but maybe not too hard. 

#             I wish I had a chess board to make working some of this stuff out a 
#             little easier. There may be one in the back. The basic patterns would
#             be more familiar to someone with a lot of experience in the game. OTOH
#             fresh eyes can often see patterns for what they are, rather then 
#             what's common knowledge. Forward!
# 
#             new algorithm:
#                 * select closest treasure by cart dist
#                 * loop (select):
#                     * d > 2.5  approach with best move
#                     * d > 2.1  capture
#                     * d > 1.4  2-space ortho
#                     * d > 1    1-space diag
#                     * d > 0    1-space ortho
#                     * d == 0   remove treasure from board and select next target
