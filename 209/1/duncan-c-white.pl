# Task 1: Special Bit Characters
# 
# You are given an array of binary bits that ends with 0.
# 
# Valid sequences in the bit string are:
# 
# [0] -decodes-to-> "a"
# [1, 0] -> "b"
# [1, 1] -> "c"
# 
# Write a script to print 1 if the last character is an 'a' otherwise
# print 0.
# 
# Example 1
# 
#   Input: @bits = (1, 0, 0)
#   Output: 1
# 
#   The given array bits can be decoded as 2-bits character (10) followed
#   by 1-bit character (0).
# 
# Example 2
# 
#   Input: @bits = (1, 1, 1, 0)
#   Output: 0
# 
#   Possible decode can be 2-bits character (11) followed by 2-bits
#   character (10) i.e. the last character is not 1-bit character.
# 
# MY NOTES: very easy.  decode string then check last letter of decoded version.
# I wonder if there's a way of decoding-and-checking together, though.
# 
# GUEST LANGUAGE: As a bonus, I also had a go at translating ch-1.pl into C
# (look in the C directory for that).
