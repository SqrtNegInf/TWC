#       Twice Largest
#         Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
#         You are given list of integers, @list.
# 
#         Write a script to find out whether the largest item in the list
#         is at least twice as large as each of the other items.
# 
#         Example 1
#             Input: @list = (1,2,3,4)
#             Output: -1
# 
#             The largest in the given list is 4. However 4 is not greater
#             than twice of every remaining elements.
#             1 x 2 <= 4
#             2 x 2 <= 4
#             2 x 3 >  4
#     
#         Example 2
#             Input: @list = (1,2,0,5)
#             Output: 1
# 
#             The largest in the given list is 5. Also 5 is greater than
#             twice of every remaining elements.
#             1 x 2 <= 5
#             2 x 2 <= 5
#             0 x 2 <= 5
#     
#         Example 3
#             Input: @list = (2,6,3,1)
#             Output: 1
# 
#             The largest in the given list is 6. Also 6 is greater than
#             twice of every remaining elements.
#             2 x 2 <= 6
#             3 x 2 <= 6
#             1 x 2 <= 6
#     
#         Example 4
#             Input: @list = (4,5,2,3)
#             Output: -1
# 
#             The largest in the given list is 5. Also 5 is not greater
#             than twice of every remaining elements.
#             4 x 2 >  5
#             2 x 2 <= 5
#             3 x 2 >  5
