### Implementation

# First approach:
# Loop over permutations, check for cute lists and count these.  This
# looks kind of insane as 15! = 1307674368000.  Not even tried it.
# 
# Second approach:
# Loop over the possible values at a given position and then recurse to
# the next position with a reduced list of values.  This works, but
# isn't really satisfying.  Dropped it.
#
# Third approach:
# Do not count the number of cute lists but calculate it instead.  A
# cute list may be regarded as a complete matching between the numbers
# from 1 to N and the N slots in the list.  A number is permitted in a
# slot, if the corresponding element in the adjacency matrix is one.
# The number of perfect matchings in an unweighted bipartite graph
# defined by its adjacency matrix A equals the permanent of A. See [2].
# For a cute list the adjacency matrix A is defined by:
#   a(i,j) = 1 if i is divisible by j or j is divisible by i and
#   a(i,j) = 0 otherwise.
# Calculating the permanent of a matrix is rather expensive.  However,
# utilizing the Balasubramanian-Bax-Franklin-Glynn formula (see [3]) the
# computation for N>15 becomes possible.  The running time roughly
# doubles when N is incremented by 1.  Here N=20 takes about 10 s and
# N=28 takes about 40 min.  Beyond that the given PDL implementation
# runs into longlong overflows on the "cute" adjacency matrix and will
# produce false results at some point.
#
# NB: Tried some different ways of implementing the better known Ryser
# formula.  None was able to keep up with B-B-F-G.  See below for the
# best of these attempts (that has more than twice the running time
# compared to the B-B-F-G implementation).
#
# NB2: What a shame! wxMaxima finds the solution for N=28 in 5 min.
