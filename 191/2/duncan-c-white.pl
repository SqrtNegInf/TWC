# Task 2: Cute List
# 
# You are given an integer, 0 < $n <= 15.
# 
# Write a script to find the number of orderings of numbers that form a cute list.
# 
# With an input @list = (1, 2, 3, .. $n) for positive integer $n, an
# ordering of @list is cute if for every entry, indexed with a base index of
# 1, either
# 
# 1) $list[$i] is evenly divisible by $i
# or
# 2) $i is evenly divisible by $list[$i]
# 
# Example
# 
# Input: $n = 2
# Ouput: 2
# 
# Since $n = 2, the list can be made up of two integers only i.e. 1 and 2.
# Therefore we can have two list i.e. (1,2) and (2,1).
# 
# @list = (1,2) is cute since $list[1] = 1 is divisible by 1 and $list[2]
# = 2 is divisible by 2.
# 
# MY NOTES: Hmm.. isn't every number divisible by 1, doesn't that mean that
# the list[1] check is unnecessary?  Looks weird but otherwise reasonably
# straightforward.  Obviously need a "next permutation of the list" iterator,
# reusing the one from Challenge 134, adapted slightly.
#
# My results: dunno if I'm doing it right, but here at my results for N=1..10:
# 1: 1
# 2: 2
# 3: 3
# 4: 8
# 5: 10
# 6: 36
# 7: 41
# 8: 132
# 9: 250
# 10: 700
# 
# GUEST LANGUAGE: As a bonus, I also had a go at translating ch-2.pl
# into C (look in the C directory for the translation)

#       3. Swap the value of a[k] with that of a[l].
#       4. Reverse the sequence from a[k + 1] up to and including the final element a[n].
