# Assuming a modern Gregorian calendar of 365 or 366 days,
# with regular leap years, there are 52 weeks (52*7 = 364)
# of five work days, and one or two extra days.  In a 365-day
# year, the 365th day will be the same day of the week as the
# 1st day.  In a 366-day week, the two extra days will be the
# same day as 1st and 2nd..
#
# So there are two cases.  For 365-day years, a year that starts
# on a workday will end on the same workday, for a total of 261.
# A year that starts on Saturday or Sunday will end on Saturday
# or Sunday for a total of 260.
#
# For a leap year, if it starts on Monday through Thursday, days
# 365 and 366 will also be work days.  If it starts on Friday,
# day 365 will be a work day, but 366 is on a Saturday.  If it
# starts on Saturday, days 365 and 366 will be a weekend.  If it
# starts on a Sunday, day 365 will be Sunday, but 366 will be
# a Monday.
#
# The extra days can be summarized in a 2x7 table, where the first
# index is 0 or 1 for leap year or not; and columns 1 to 7 correspond
# to days of the week with 1 == Monday. (Ignoring index 0 because
# this 1-through-7 is the way that DateTime counts.)
