Perl Weekly Challenge 138
=========================

TASK #1
-------
*Workdays*

Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar

You are given a year, $year in 4-digits form.

Write a script to calculate the total number of workdays in the given year.

    For the task, we consider, Monday - Friday as workdays.

Example 1

 Input: $year = 2021
 Output: 261

Example 2

 Input: $year = 2020
 Output: 262

Algorithm
---------
A common year has 365 days, a leap year 366. 52 weeks is 364 days, and those 52
weeks are guaranteed to contain (52 * 5) = 260 "workdays". So the total number
of workdays in the year is determined by whether the extra days -- 1 in a
common year, or 2 in a leap year -- fall on or between weekends.

If a year begins on a Monday, then the final day of the 52-week block of days
must be a Sunday: in which case, the following day(s) fall between weekends. A
similar reasoning is easily applied to the other days of the week. For example,
if the year begins on a Sunday, then the final day of the 52-week block of days
must be a Saturday, and therefore the following day falls on a Sunday, and does
NOT add to the total of workdays; but the day after that (if this is a leap
year) falls on a Monday and DOES add to the total.

In the solution below, these extra days have been pre-computed and stored in
the constant arrays @COMMON and @LEAP_Y. The CPAN DateTime module is used to
determine the day of the week on which the first day of the year falls, and
also whether or not the year is a leap year. (Note the use of DateTime's
day_of_week_0() method, which returns weekdays in 0-based order beginning with
Monday.)
