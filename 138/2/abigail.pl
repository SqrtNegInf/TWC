#
# If $target exceeds $number, we return 0, as we cannot split a number into
# parts and have it sum to something larger.
# If $target equals $number, we return 1, as we can trivial fulfill this.
#
# Else, we take ever larger parts from the end, subtract that part from
# $target, and recurse. If no part succeeds, we have a failure. If any
# part succeeds, we have a winner.
#
# Note that the only two numbers where the sqrt is equal to itself are
# 0 and 1 -- we have to exclude those as we need to split the original
# number into at least two parts. For all other numbers, its square root
# will be less, so not splitting the original number can't sum to the
# square root.
