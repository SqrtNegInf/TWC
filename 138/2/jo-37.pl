### Input and Output

say 0 + root_sum(shift);


### Implementation

sub root_sum ($n) {
    # Split N into at least two parts and compare the squared sum of the
    # parts with N.
    # There is no need to disallow leading zeros in any part (except the
    # first), as these may be split-off as separate parts resulting in
    # the same sum and a larger number of parts, e.g.
    # 201: 2 + 01 or 2 + 0 + 1.
    # The only exception are single digit numbers that cannot be split
    # into two parts and therefore must not have leading zeros.
    our $sum;
    $n =~ m{
        ^
        (?=\d+$)    # Numbers only.
        (?!0+.$)    # Forbid leading zeros for 1-digit numbers.
        (?{local $sum = 0})   # Initialize and localize the part sum.
        (?:
            (.+)    # capture one part
            (?{local $sum = $sum + $^N})    # backtracking-safe part sum
        ){2,}       # two or more parts
        $

        # Check part sum for complete matches:
        (?(?{$sum ** 2 != $n}) (*FAIL))
