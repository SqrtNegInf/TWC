# The average of a solution group will == the average of the whole array.
# The average of a solution group is .sum/.elems,
# and .elems is fixed during each loop of $group_size,
# so we can pre-calculate the sum to search for.
# A further optimization comes from the task specifying that all elements are integers.
# Their sum must be an integer, so if the "target sum" is not an integer, we can skip the whole group of that size.
# e.g. 1..8 has an average of 9/2; a group of size 3 can never average to 9/2, because the divisor will be 3.
