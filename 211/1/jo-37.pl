### Implementation

# A NxM matrix (N,M > 1) has N + M - 3 diagonals having more than one
# element.  Creating a set of NxN matrices where each of them have one
# of the orignal matrix' diagonals as its main diagonal.  Then take the
# diagonal of these matrices and re-arrange them into a new matrix
# having the main diagonals of the matrix series as rows. Taking minimum
# and maximum over the rows.  If min and max equals for every row, the
# matrix is Toeplitz.
# Note: Utilizing BAD values in incomplete diagonals that do not account
# for minimum or maximum.
sub is_toeplitz {
	(my $m = pdl @_)->badflag(1);
    my ($min, $max) = (
        cat map $_->diagonal(0, 1),
        $m->range($m->dim(0) - 2 - sequence(indx, 1, $m->shape->sum - 3),
            $m->dim(1), 't')
        ->reorder(1,2,0)->dog
    )->minmaximum;

    all $min == $max;
