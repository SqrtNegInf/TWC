Task 1: First Unique Character      Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar

Given a string, $s, find the first unique character in the
string and print its index (0-based).

Examples:
Input: $s = "Perl Weekly Challenge"
Output: 0 as 'P' is the first unique character

Input: $s = "Long Live Perl"
Output: 1 as 'o' is the first unique character

sub first-unique-char ( Str $s is copy, Bool :$i --> Int ) {
    $s = $s.fc if $i;
    my $b = Bag.new:   my @c = $s.comb();
    @c.first( { $b{$_} === 1}, :k );
}

if TEST {
    my @Test = 
        { in => 'abcdeA',        exp => 0, iexp =>  1 },
        { in => 'abcdeabcD',     exp => 3, iexp =>  4 },
        { in => 'abcddefabcEfg', exp => 5, iexp => 12 },
    ;

    for @Test -> %t {
        is first-unique-char(%t<in>),      %t<exp>, "%t<in>";
