# Task 1: First Unique Character
# 
# You are given a string, $s.
# Write a script to find out the first unique character in the given string
# and print its index (0-based).
# 
# Example 1
# 
# Input: $s = "Perl Weekly Challenge"
# Output: 0 as 'P' is the first unique character
# 
# Example 2
# 
# Input: $s = "Long Live Perl"
# Output: 1 as 'o' is the first unique character
# 
# MY NOTES: ok, sounds extremely easy, first pass: build a freq hash (a bag),
# second pass: sequence through the string, print index of the first char
# with freq 1.  There is one case where the behaviour is undefined: what if
# there are no unique characters in the string? I've decided to produce pos -1
# in that case.
# 
# GUEST LANGUAGE: As a bonus, I also had a go at translating ch-1.pl
# into C (look in the C directory for that).
