### Input and Output

say hamming(pop);


### Implementation

# I have no idea why one would call the sequence A051037 "ugly numbers".
# Wikipedia calls them "regular" (after some discussion about a proper
# name), OEIS "5-smooth" and others "Hamming" numbers.  I'll call them
# "Hamming numbers" in the following.
#
# Generating the Hamming numbers is known as "Hamming's problem".
# Evolved implementations follow a path of augmenting the initial
# one-element sequence (1) with a merger of its own 2-, 3- and 5-fold.
# The most advanced I could find was David Eppstein's Python
# implementation, see last reference.  The implementation here is just a
# plain Perl port of his.  Python has a built-in "yield" statement,
# which makes a Perl port look a bit involved at first, until I
# discovered "Coro::Generator" leading to a straightforward solution.
# My first naive implementation (based on the exclusion of non-Hamming
# numbers) needed 30s to find hamming(1000), whereas now hamming(10000)
# can be calculated in the wink of an eye.  Or consider:
# 'time' perl -Mbigint ch-1.pl 1000000
