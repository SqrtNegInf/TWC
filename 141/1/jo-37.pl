### Input and Output

main: {
    my $gen_num_div = gen_num_div($count);
    say $gen_num_div->() for 1 .. shift;
}


### Implementation

# Build a generator for numbers having exactly C divisors. Though this
# my be accomplished easily by just counting the divisors, the task
# itself seems to have very interesting aspects.  At first glance the
# sequences for prime numbers C seem to be the primes to the power of
# C - 1.  Sadly, I don't have time to investigate this in detail.

    generator {
        for (my $n = 1;; $n++) {
            yield $n if divisor_sum($n, 0) == $c;
        }
    }
}


### Examples and tests

        #skip "examples" unless $examples;
        is gen_num_div(8)->(), 24, 'example 1'

    }

        #skip "tests" unless $tests;

        is $gen_num_div_8->(), 318, 'see http://oeis.org/A030626';

        my $gen_num_div_6 = gen_num_div(6);
