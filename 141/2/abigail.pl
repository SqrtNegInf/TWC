# The challenge isn't clear whether it wants a count of all possible
# numbers which match, or the number of unique numbers. For instance,
# an input of 
#                1232 2
#
# would yield 12 twice. Do we count them both? Or are we supposed to
# only count unique once? The examples are of no help. 
#
# Furthermore, what about leading 0s? An input of
#
#                102 2
#
# yield both 02 and 2. (And something like '100 3' will yield
# 0, 0 and 00).
#
# We've decided to be as inclusive as possible. So
#
#                1232 2
#
# will give 12, 122, 132, 12, 2, 232, 22, 32, and 2, for a total of 9.
#
# and
#                102 2
#
# will give 10, 12, 0, 02, and 2, for a total of 5.
