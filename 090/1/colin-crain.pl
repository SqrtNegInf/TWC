#         TASK #1 â€º DNA Sequence
#         Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
#
#         DNA is a long, chainlike molecule which has two strands twisted into a
#         double helix. The two strands are made up of simpler molecules called
#         nucleotides. Each nucleotide is composed of one of the four
#         nitrogen-containing nucleobases cytosine (C), guanine (G), adenine (A)
#         and thymine (T).
#
#         You are given DNA sequence,
#
#             GTAAACCCCTTTTCATTTAGACAGATCGACTCCTTATCCATTCTCAGAGATGTGTTGCTGGTCGCCG.
#
#         Write a script to print nucleiobase count in the given DNA sequence.
#         Also print the complementary sequence where Thymine (T) on one strand
#         is always facing an adenine (A) and vice versa; guanine (G) is always
#         facing a cytosine (C) and vice versa.
#
#         To get the complementary sequence use the following mapping:
#
#             T => A
#             A => T
#             G => C
#             C => G
