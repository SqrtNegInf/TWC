# ch-2.pl Perl Weekly Challenge 274 Task 2 Bus Route
#=============================================================================
# Several bus routes start from a bus stop near my home, and go to the same
# stop in town. They each run to a set timetable, but they take different
# times to get into town.
#
# Write a script to find the times - if any - I should let one bus leave and
# catch a strictly later one in order to get into town strictly sooner.
#
# An input timetable consists of the service interval, the offset within the
# hour, and the duration of the trip.
# Example 1 Input: [ [12, 11, 41], [15, 5, 35] ]
#           Output: [36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47]
#   Route 1 leaves every 12 minutes, starting at 11 minutes past the
#   hour (so 11, 23, ...) and takes 41 minutes. Route 2 leaves every
#   15 minutes, starting at 5 minutes past (5, 20, ...) and takes
#   35 minutes. At 45 minutes past the hour I could take the route 1
#   bus at 47 past the hour, arriving at 28 minutes past the following
#   hour, but if I wait for the route 2 bus at 50 past I will get to
#   town sooner, at 25 minutes past the next hour.
#
# Example 2 Input: [ [12, 3, 41], [15, 9, 35], [30, 5, 25] ]
#           Output: [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 25, 26, 27, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59 ]
