# Task1: Jumping Letters:  Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar;  You are given a word having alphabetic characters only, and a list of positive integers of the
#   same length. Write a script to print the new word generated after jumping forward each letter in the given word by the integer in the list.
#   The given list would have exactly the number as the total alphabets in the given word.
# Example1:
#   In-put: $word = 'Perl' and @jump = (2,22,19,9)
#   Output: Raku
#     'P' jumps 2  place forward and becomes 'R'.
#     'e' jumps 22 place forward and becomes 'a'. (jump is cyclic i.e. after 'z' you go back to 'a')
#     'r' jumps 19 place forward and becomes 'k'.
#     'l' jumps 9  place forward and becomes 'u'.
# Example2:
#   In-put: $word = 'Raku' and @jump = (24,4,7,17)
#   Output: 'Perl'
