# In hindsight, I might have taken a different approach. I like the one-time .sort into an Array of Pairs, but Pairs are immutable, which requires the clumsy reconstruction in line 17, instead of just `.value--`.
#
# Note that the Bag will keep its keys untransformed, while a Hash would have (by default) had Str keys, which would have sorted wrong unless otherwise coerced.
#
# I could have further restricted the type of `ns` in the signatures, but I did not want to complicate the calling test code.
