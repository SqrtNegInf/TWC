# Mohammad gives us an easy one with "The Weekly Challenge", 
# where we can easily split on spaces and reverse, but padding
# spaces at the front and end of the next example make things harder.
# I mean, we COULD just use a regular expression to pull out the 
# begining and ending spaces, but splitting on /\s/ (space characters) 
# and grepping for /\S/ (non-space characters would be OK)

# but a space character isn't a word boundary. I asked and brian d foy
# gave me good advice about word boundaries. I mean, I asked the Internet
# and found his blog post:
#   https://www.effectiveperlprogramming.com/2016/06/perl-v5-22-adds-fancy-unicode-word-boundaries/

# I threw in the line from Buffalo Springfield's "For What It's Worth"
# because it adds an apostrophe, which confounds the pre-5.22 default 
# word border separation.

# This is a very pipe-y, very Dave way of doing this. Beyond the

# grep to make sure that there's something non-space, revers and 
# join with a space. I am sure a confounding string can be created
# but I'll engage that when the challenge is presented.
