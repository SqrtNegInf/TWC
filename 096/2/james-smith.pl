## Notes:
## --------------------------------------------------------------------
##
## I'm just going to add "Another day job challenge!"
##
## To be able to make "nicer" output - rather than just keeping track
## of the edit distance of substrings - we will actually keep the
## alignment of the two words as a string of "operations" whether they
## be Indels or SNPs.
##
## {One of my background is working with genomic data and this can be
## thought of as a simple alignment algorithm - and so I think of the
## three operations as Indels {inserts/deletes - remembering an insert
## into one sequence is just the same as a delete from the other} and
## SNPs - or single nucleotide polymorphisms.
##
## The simple alignment string representation we will use consists of:
##   '|' - the letters are the same;
##   'v' - insert
##   '^' - delete
##   ' ' - SNP/modify
##
## We can convert this to an edit distance by counting all the non-"|"s
## In perl we do this with tr/^v /^v / which returns the number of
## matches in scalar form. See {_edit_dist - function}
##
## Finally we include a nice way to render the alignment {edits}
## By showing the two words with appropriate inserts in each word
## and indicate where the letters match in each word via a the
## alignment string in the middle
##
## Additional note - we "memoise" the alignment function - as it will
## be called with the same subseq of letters following different paths
## through the two sequences. This increases performance...
##
## From a "genomic" point of view this is known as the basis of the
## Smith-Waterman local alignment algorithm. Although Smith-Waterman
## has other features - including variable "penalties" for each type
## of edit {inserts, deletes, modifications}. Even having different
## penalties for certain changes {this is also similar to how typing
## correction software works - with assuming adjacent key typos are
## more likely.
##
