# The challenge isn't quite clear on whether we should output a number
# (the minimal number of operations required), or the actual operations.
# The examples show both -- but separated by a blank line. Previous
# challenges typically use a blank line to separate the required output
# from the explaination on why that it is the correct answer.
#
# We're opting to only print the number of operations, not the actual
# operations.
