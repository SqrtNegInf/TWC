#         Hexadecimal Words
#         Submitted by: Ryan J Thompson
#         As an old systems programmer, whenever I needed to come up with a
#         32-bit number, I would reach for the tired old examples like
#         0xDeadBeef and 0xC0dedBad. I want more!
# 
#         Write a program that will read from a dictionary and find 2- to
#         8-letter words that can be “spelled” in hexadecimal, with the
#         addition of the following letter substitutions:
# 
#             o ⟶ 0 (e.g., 0xf00d = “food”)
#             l ⟶ 1
#             i ⟶ 1
#             s ⟶ 5
#             t ⟶ 7
#     
#         You can use your own dictionary or you can simply open
#         ../../../data/dictionary.txt (relative to your script’s location
#         in our GitHub repository) to access the dictionary of common
#         words from Week #161.
# 
#         Optional Extras (for an 0xAddedFee, of course!) Limit the number
#         of “special” letter substitutions in any one result to keep that
#         result at least somewhat comprehensible. (0x51105010 is an actual
#         example from my sample solution you may wish to avoid!)
# 
#         Find phrases of words that total 8 characters in length (e.g.,
#         0xFee1Face), rather than just individual words.
