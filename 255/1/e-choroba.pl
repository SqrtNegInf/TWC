Language, except when it doesn't.

Perl was originally a language optimized for scanning arbitrary text
files, extracting information from those text files, and printing
reports based on that information. It quickly became a good language
for many system management tasks. Over the years, Perl has grown into
a general-purpose programming language. It's widely used for
everything from quick "one-liners" to full-scale application
development.);
