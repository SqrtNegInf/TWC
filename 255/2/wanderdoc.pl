You are given a paragraph $p and a banned word $w. Write a script to return the most frequent word that is not banned.

Example 1
Input: $p = "Joe hit a ball, the hit ball flew far after it was hit."
	   $w = "hit"
Output: "ball"
The banned word "hit" occurs 3 times. The other word "ball" occurs 2 times.

Example 2
Input: $p = "Perl and Raku belong to the same family. Perl is the most popular language in the weekly challenge."
	   $w = "the"
Output: "Perl"
The banned word "the" occurs 3 times. The other word "Perl" occurs 2 times.
