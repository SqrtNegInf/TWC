Perl Weekly Challenge 255
=========================

TASK #2
-------
*Most Frequent Word*

Submitted by: Mohammad Sajid Anwar

You are given a paragraph $p and a banned word $w.

Write a script to return the most frequent word that is not banned.

Example 1

  Input: $p = "Joe hit a ball, the hit ball flew far after it was hit."
         $w = "hit"
  Output: "ball"

  The banned word "hit" occurs 3 times.
  The other word "ball" occurs 2 times.

Example 2

  Input: $p = "Perl and Raku belong to the same family. Perl is the most popular
               language in the weekly challenge."
         $w = "the"
  Output: "Perl"

  The banned word "the" occurs 3 times.
  The other word "Perl" occurs 2 times.

Interface
---------
1. If no command-line arguments are given, the test suite is run. Otherwise:
2. If $VERBOSE is set to a true value, the output is followed by a short explan-
   ation like those in the Examples.

Assumptions
-----------
1. "Words" are composed of the letters A-Z, a-z, and ' (the apostrophe) ONLY.
2. Different forms of the same root word are treated as different words:
   "belong", "belongs", and "belonged" are 3 distinct words; "Perl" and "Perl's"
   are 2 distinct words.
3. Hyphenated words are not recognised as such: e.g., "cul-de-sac" is treated
   as 3 separate words.
4. Capitalisation.
   If a word appears with its initial letter both capitalised and uncapitalised,
   AND each occurrence of the capitalised version appears at the beginning of a
   sentence, then (and only then) the different forms are considered to be a
   single word, and that word's uncapitalised form is treated as canonical.
5. If two or more words share the same maximum frequency of occurrence, the
   alphabetically-first word is given as the output.
