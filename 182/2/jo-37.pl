### Input and Output

say common_base_dir(@ARGV);


### Implementation

# The example seems to be easy, but a closer look uncovers some issues:
# - The result in the example does not end in a slash.  However, this
#   cannot not affect the leading slash.  A common root path still
#   consists of a single slash.
# - The given paths may not be canonical.  As the canonicalization was
#   already solved in week 112, I'll take the given paths as canonical.
# - All paths in the example end in a file name.  What if the final
#   file part is empty and the path ends in a slash?  I'm going to
#   distinguish these cases with /a/b and /a/b/c having /a as the
#   common base directory whereas /a/b/ and /a/b/c having /a/b in
#   common.
# - Though a trailing slash is not wanted in the final result, it needs
#   to be present in the matching process.  Otherwise partial directory
#   name matches could give false results.

sub common_base_dir {
    # Remove a trailing (possibly empty) file part, concatenate the two
    # elements inside the "reduce" block with a NULL character in
    # between (it cannot be part of a file path) and match the maximum
    # common path from the beginning of both elements.  Take the common
    # path as the new reduction.  Finally remove a slash from the result
    # if it is not the single starting slash.
    # NB1: Here a path is a string starting with a slash followed by
    # zero or more nonempty directory names followed by a slash.
    # NB2: Using "\N{NULL}" here instead of the shorter "\0" to make it
    # clear that this is something completely different from "\1".
    (reduce {
            "$a\N{NULL}$b" =~ m{^(/(?:[^/]+/)*).*?\N{NULL}\1}s;
            $1;
        } map {s{/\K[^/]*$}{}r} @_
    ) =~ s{(?<!^)/$}{}r;
