# Task 2: Common Path
# Submitted by: Julien Fiegehenn
# 
# Given a list of absolute Linux file paths, determine the deepest path
# to the directory that contains all of them.
# 
# Example
# 
# Input:
#     /a/b/c/1/x.pl
#     /a/b/c/d/e/2/x.pl
#     /a/b/c/d/3/x.pl
#     /a/b/c/4/x.pl
#     /a/b/c/d/5/x.pl
# 
# Output:
#     /a/b/c
# 
# MY NOTES: that's a really interesting problem, and I like ones related to
# filesystems as I'm a sysadmin.  Now, what data structure would be perfect
# to help us answer this question?  Is it as simple as "longest common path
# prefix so far", i.e. start as the whole dirname (remove only the file part),
# and then for each new filepath entry check whether the new entry shares the
# whole "longest common path prefix", and if not, repeatedly remove the last
# dir part until it does:-)  The point is that the common path only ever gets
# shorter as we process more paths.  Will need to ensure that the code also
# handles the / (no common path other than root) case properly.
# 
# GUEST LANGUAGE: As a bonus, I also had a go at translating ch-2.pl
# into C (look in the C directory for that).
