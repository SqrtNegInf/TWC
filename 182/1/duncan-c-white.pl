# Task 1: Max Index
# 
# You are given a list of integers.
# Write a script to find the index of the first biggest number in the list.
# 
# Example
# 
# Input: @n = (5, 2, 9, 1, 7, 6)
# Output: 2 (as 3rd element in the list is the biggest number)
# 
# Input: @n = (4, 2, 3, 1, 5, 0)
# Output: 4 (as 5th element in the list is the biggest number)
# 
# MY NOTES: nice and easy.
#
# GUEST LANGUAGE: As a bonus, I also had a go at translating ch-1.pl
# into C (look in the C directory for that).
