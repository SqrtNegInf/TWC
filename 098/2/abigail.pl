# Each line is assumed to be a white space separated list of
# numbers. The first number is the target number (`$N`), the rest of
# the numbers is the array (`@N`).
#
# Now, we could implement a binary search to find the target in
# O (log N) time, but why bother? We need to read the array, which
# means we're already spending linear time; furthermore, we have to
# insert element if not found -- which is a worst case linear time
# operation anyway. So, we just do a linear scan.
#
# Note that we insert $N into @N by adding it to the end, and then
# sorting -- which is linear in Perl (as the list (@N, $N) is nearly
# sorted). We then use a goto to go back to the search; this is 
# guaranteed to succeed.

    # Not found. Insert by adding to the end and sorting.
    #
    @N = sort {$a <=> $b} @N, $N;

    #
    # Now, do the search again -- this time, it will succeed.
