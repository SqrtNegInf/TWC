# First question we need to ask for any date related exercise is
# "What calendar are we using?". If you answer "Gregorian", then
# the next question is, "Where are we using the calendar?", as 
# different countries switched to the Gregorian calendar at different
# times. The first countries switched in the 16th century, but others
# switched as late as the 20th century.
#

#
# We will opt to use the proleptic Gregorian calendar, which is basically
# the Gregorian calendar extended backwards to the time no Gregorian 
# calender existed.
#
# Since the format is given as YYYY/MM/DD, we will assume non-negative years.
#

#
# We could pull one of the gazillion date modules from CPAN and let it
# do the calculations. But we'll do the calculations ourselves. We'll
# take the date, calculate its Julian Day number (rounded down, as we don't
# care about hours and minutes), compare it to the Julian Day number of today,
# and then calculate the Julian Day numbers of the target dates, after
# which we convert them back to dates.
