    Task 2: Collect Points
    Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
    You are given a list of numbers.

    You will perform a series of removal operations. For each operation, you remove from the list N (one or more) equal and consecutive numbers, and add to your score N Ã— N.

    Determine the maximum possible score.

    Example 1:
    Input: @numbers = (2,4,3,3,3,4,5,4,2)
    Output: 23

    We see three 3's next to each other so let us remove that first and collect 3 x 3 points.
    So now the list is (2,4,4,5,4,2).
    Let us now remove 5 so that all 4's can be next to each other and collect 1 x 1 point.
    So now the list is (2,4,4,4,2).
    Time to remove three 4's and collect 3 x 3 points.
    Now the list is (2,2).
    Finally remove both 2's and collect 2 x 2 points.
    So the total points collected is 9 + 1 + 9 + 4 => 23.
    Example 2:
    Input: @numbers = (1,2,2,2,2,1)
    Output: 20

    Remove four 2's first and collect 4 x 4 points.
    Now the list is (1,1).
    Finally remove the two 1's and collect 2 x 2 points.
    So the total points collected is 16 + 4 => 20.
    Example 3:
    Input: @numbers = (1)
    Output: 1
    Example 4:
    Input: @numbers = (2,2,2,1,1,2,2,2)
    Output: 40

    Remove two 1's = 2 x 2 points.
    Now the list is (2,2,2,2,2,2).
    Then reomove six 2's = 6 x 6 points.
