# We're MOSTLY expected to get the bell number, which is
# the number of unique partitions -- [[a],[b]] == [[b],[a]] --
# so I do some of the administrivia in bell_number() and
# do the bulk of the work in _bell_number().

# in my first pass, I got myself confused with adding
# second-level arrays as needed, so instead, I start with
# a larger-than-needed set of arrays and fill from there.

# The first ten bell numbers are:
# 1,
# 1,
# 2,
# 5,
# 15,
# 52,
# 203,
# 877,
# 4140

# The key, then, is to grep filled arrays, because
#   [],[],[],[a]
# is equivalent to
#   [a]
# and sort by initial entry, because
#   [a,b],[c]
# is equivalent to
#   [c],[a,b]

# We now stringify the arrayref to JSON with encode, and
# between filtering and uniq, ensure that it doesn't get
# TOO big, otherwise this segfaults at n=8 or so.

# the question ASKS for the Bell number, but the examples
# show all the partitions that go into that, so...
