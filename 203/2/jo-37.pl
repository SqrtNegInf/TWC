### Implementation

# Find directories in the source tree and create corresponding
# directories in the target tree if no such file exists yet.  At least
# the parent directory of the target must exist beforehand.

# A small test driver for copy_dirs:
# - Create a working and an expectation directory.
# - Populate the source directory tree in the working directory
# - Populate the target directory tree - at least up to the target's
#   parent directory - in the working directory.
# - Populate the expectation directory.
# - Call copy_dirs on the prepared source and target directories in the
#   working directory.
# - Compare the target directory in the working directory with the
#   expected result in the expectation directory.
#
# Arguments:
# - An array ref to a list of directories/files in the working directory
#   where copy_dirs will be called.
# - An array ref to a list of directories/files that are expected as the
#   result after copy_dirs has been called.
# - A source path within the working directory.
# - A target path within the working directory.
# - A test case title.
#
# Entries in a directory list ending with a slash are interpreted as
# directories and as plain files otherwise.  Parent directories must be
# specified and precede their content in the list.
#
# Limitations:
# There are no provisions to check for expected errors in neither phase
# of the test.
