### Input and Output

say join ',', @{succ_seq(shift)};


### Implementation

# Splitting any kind of sequence into smaller subsequences preserves
# their original order.  Assuming this interpretation in accordance with
# the examples.
# Furthermore, the difference between two consecutive parts shall always
# be one, or in other words: each part (except the first) shall be the
# successor of the previous.  As leading zeros are not allowed for a
# part, every subsequent part is thus uniquely determined by its
# predecessor.
# Given that Perl's auto-increment operator acts on strings too,
# excessively large numbers may be processed as long as they are
# provided as strings.  See test cases.

sub succ_seq {
    local $_ = shift;
    # As the input is taken as a string, leading zeros must be excluded,
    # since    ++($_ = '01') eq '02'   is true.  Luckily this is a
    # prerequisite in the task.
    die "not valid\n" unless /^[1-9][0-9]+\z/;

    # Try first parts that have half of the string's length at most.
    for my $len (1 .. length() / 2) {
        # Accept any first part having the current length.
        my $part = qr/.{$len}/;

        my @split;
        while (/\G($part)/g) {
            # Collect the matched part and take its successor as the
            # next expected match.
            push @split, ($part = $1)++;
            # If the current match extends to the end of the string, the
            # collected parts represent a solution.
            return \@split if pos() == length();
        }
    }

    # Default:
    [$_];
