# We will be using one of four different ways to check whether the sum
# of the squares is a square:
#
#  - sqrt:        Use sqrt () to get the square root of the sum of squares;
#                 we round this to an integer and square it, and check whether
#                 we have the same number. This is the fastest way, but it
#                 requires us to deal with floating point numbers and rounding
#                 errors. (This will be the default if no argument is given).
#  - count:       We'll start counting from 1, and square the numbers.
#                 If at one point the square equals the sum of squares,
#                 we have success. If we exceed the sum of squares without
#                 hitting it, the sum of squares isn't a perfect square.
#                 This sounds inefficient, but the sum of squares is at
#                 most 81 * N, where N indicates the number of input digits.
#                 This means we at most have to check 9 * sqrt (N) numbers,
#                 so its running time is O (sqrt (N)), which is far less
#                 than calculating the sum of squares, which is O (N).
#   - search:     First use a doubling method to find a number X such that
#                 X * X is greater than the sum of squares. Then use binary
#                 search to find out whether the sum of squares is a square.
#                 The running time will be O (log sqrt (N)), also far less
#                 than calculating the sum of squares.
#   - preprocess: Calculate the first 9000 squares. Then we can do an O (1)
#                 lookup. 9000 squares will work for all numbers up to one
#                 million digits (and for many, many, more numbers).
