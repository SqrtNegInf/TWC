# Task 1: MAC Address
# 
# You are given MAC address in the form i.e. hhhh.hhhh.hhhh.
# 
# Write a script to convert the address in the form hh:hh:hh:hh:hh:hh.
# 
# Example 1
# 
# Input:  1ac2.34f0.b1c2
# Output: 1a:c2:34:f0:b1:c2
# 
# Example 2
# 
# Input:  abc1.20f1.345a
# Output: ab:c1:20:f1:34:5a
# 
# MY NOTES: nice and easy.
#
# GUEST LANGUAGE: As a bonus, I also had a go at translating ch-1.pl
# into C (look in the C directory for that).
