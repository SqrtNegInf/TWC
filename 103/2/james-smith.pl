  ## beginning - so we can do the slurp in a single line
  ##
  ## Rather than using a full CSV library we split on ,"
  ## as this works for the set of data that we have in
  ## the problem but we could use Text::CSV for more
  ## complex strings.
  ##
  ## Note values in @episodes are triples (the third is
  ## any part of the string after the second " which
  ## happens just to be "\n"

  ## how far we have wrapped around the time slots ....

  ## Note we have to multiple the difference by 1000

  ## now/start in seconds.

    ## want to return... As it is milliseconds we don't
    ## just divide by 60 & 3600 we have to multiply
    ## these divisors by 1000
    ##
    ## Rather than return an array of two values name
    ## and position - we return as a string - this is
    ## to make the test call easier byt we could just
    ## return [ $_->[0], $position ] which is the second
    ## half of the sprintf '%02d:%02d:%02d', ....
