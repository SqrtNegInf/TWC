# Each of the cycles have been rotated so the first entry corresponds to
# the year 0 in the Proleptic Gregorian calendar. (We're using the
# convention of having a year 0, as per ISO 8601).
# That way, we can just mod the year with the number of entries, without
# first having to subtract something from the year.
#
# The heavenly stems last for 2 years, so we just duplicate the entries.
