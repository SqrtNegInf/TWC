# You are given a list of integers.
# Write a script to get the maximum points. You are allowed to take out (kill)
# any integer and remove from the list. However if you do that then all
# integers exactly one-less or one-more would also be removed. Find out the
# total of integers removed.
# Example 1 Input: @int = (2, 3, 1) Output: 6
#   First we delete 2 and that would also delete 1 and 3. So the maximum
#   points we get is 6.
# Example 2 Input: @int = (1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3) Output: 11
#   First we delete 2 and that would also delete both the 1's and the 3.
#   Now we have (2, 2).  Then we delete another 2 and followed by the third
#   deletion of 2. So the maximum points we get is 11.
