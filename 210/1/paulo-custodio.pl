#
# Task 1: Kill and Win
# Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
#
# You are given a list of integers.
#
# Write a script to get the maximum points. You are allowed to take out (kill)
# any integer and remove from the list. However if you do that then all
# integers exactly one-less or one-more would also be removed. Find out the
# total of integers removed.
# Example 1
#
# Input: @int = (2, 3, 1)
# Output: 6
#
# First we delete 2 and that would also delete 1 and 3. So the maximum points
# we get is 6.
#
# Example 2
#
# Input: @int = (1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3)
# Output: 11
#
# First we delete 2 and that would also delete both the 1's and the 3. Now we
# have (2, 2).
# Then we delete another 2 and followed by the third deletion of 2. So the
# maximum points we get is 11.
