# Task1: Kill and Win:  Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar;  You are given a list of integers.
#   Write a script to get the maximum points. You are allowed to take out (kill) any integer and remove from the list.
#     However if you do that then all integers exactly one-less or one-more would also be removed. Find out the total of integers removed.
# Example1:
#   In-put: @int = (2, 3, 1)
#   Output:         6                 First we delete 2 and that would also delete 1 and 3. So the maximum points we get is 6.
# Example2:
#   In-put: @int = (1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3)
#   Output:        11                 First we delete 2 and that would also delete both the 1's and the 3. Now we have (2, 2).
#     Then we delete another 2 and followed by the third deletion of 2. So the maximum points we get is 11.
