# Task2: Number Collision:  Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar;  You are given an array of integers which can move in right direction if it is positive and left
#   direction when negative. If two numbers collide then the smaller one will explode. And if both are same then they both explode. We take the absolute value
#     in consideration when comparing.  All numbers move at the same speed, therefore any 2 numbers moving in the same direction will never collide.
#   Write a script to find out who survives the collision.
# Example1:
#   In-put: @list = (2, 3, -1)
#   Output:         (2, 3    ) The numbers 3 and -1 collide and -1 explodes in the end. So we are left with (2, 3).
# Example2:
#   In-put: @list = (3, 2, -4)
#   Output:         (      -4) The numbers 2 and -4 collide and 2 explodes in the end. That gives us (3, -4).
#     Now the numbers 3 and -4 collide and 3 explodes. Finally we are left with -4.
# Example3:
#   In-put: @list = (1,    -1)
#   Output:         (        ) The numbers 1 and -1 both collide and explode. Nothing left in the end.
# Last date to submit the solution 23:59 (UK Time) Sunday 2nd April 2023.
