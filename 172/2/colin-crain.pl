#         Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
#         You are given an array of integers.
# 
#         Write a script to compute the five-number summary of the given
#         set of integers.
# 
#         You can find the definition and example in the 
#         [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-number_summary).
# 
#       BACKGROUND
# 
#         In statistics, mathematical analysis is performed on what are
#         large datasets. In this analysis, individual data points are
#         deemphasized, and we look beyond the individual values in an
#         effort to infer general statements about the collection as  a
#         whole. The data itself is usually empirical in origin, gathered
#         from real-world phenomena, and as such are always subject to some
#         degree of collection or recording error. Much of statistical
#         analysis addresses the precision within the dataset, assigning
#         numerical weights to the confidence in the values, which can be
#         mathematically extrapolated as a caveat onto any conclusions
#         made. The analysis, after all, can only be as good as the data it
#         comes from.
# 
#         Given some collection of data, when seeking a normal,
#         representative, middle value, it might not be immediately obvious
#         that this idea can be approached in more than one way. There are
#         in fact quite a few. We could for instance find an arithmetic
#         average, a mean value, summing and dividing, but that is only one
#         of several mean values available to us.  We explored this idea in
#         PWC157, calculating the Pythagorean Means. Ultimately the
#         derivation of the data itself determines the best fit for the
#         job.
# 
#         But even the average, an average, isn't necessarily meaningfully
#         representative. Another thing we could look at is what value
#         occurs most often. To take an extreme case, if the data isn't
#         numerically related at all this can be a better way to summarize,
#         obviously. If one number keeps showing up there is presumably
#         some reason to be inferred.
# 
#         One somewhat radical approach to select a representative sample
#         is to order the data and take the literal middle value.
#         Arithmetically this doesn't make much sense, but statistically it
#         does, as one unexpected benefit of this method is its remarkable
#         resiliency against spurious, outlier data points.
# 
#         Given a collection of values of human heights, one might expect a
#         range between extremes,  with babies at maybe 30cm and large
#         adults at somewhat over 200cm. Averaging all of these might tell
#         you something, but I'm not sure what. Depending on how many
#         babies are involved the number might be around say, 150cm?  Just
#         guessing here. However a single data entry error for the
#         kilometers traveled on business for a year: 5000km, would not
#         only make that average useless but also poison any further use of
#         the value downstream. Using a median, though, the bad outlier
#         data would only move the central element slightly, with about
#         equal probability up or down. Our monsterous error has been
#         transformed into a slight loss of precision.
# 
#         The quartitles are an extension of this data-levelling idea into
#         two more subdivisions on either side of the median, to slot in
#         and combine with the median to provide points at 25%, 50%, and
#         75%. Exactly how these points are arrived at is not universally
#         decided.
# 
#         The problem arrives when we wish to  take the median of one-half
#         the data. If the whole set has a discrete median, do we include
#         that when calculating one-half the data? Including it will make
#         each computed half slightly larger than a real half, and not
#         including it will make the cut smaller. There are more exact
#         methods to accommodate more even division but we have to stop and
#         consider the imprecision of the median itself before we make
#         things more unnecessarily more complicated. Uncertainty carries
#         over through the calculations, and the median is not the mean.
# 
#         It should be added that should we require a rigorous mathematical
#         certainty there are well-defined approaches to looking at the way
#         data is distributed within a range, such as the standard
#         deviation. So we have that if we want it. On the other hand if
#         we're looking for the middle, a representative low number, a
#         representative high number, and a set of outer boundaries that
#         all the data lies inside, then the 5-number summary has proven to
#         be a pretty practical start at getting the feel of a dataset Ñ
#         arithmetically imperfect as it may be.
# 
#       METHOD
# 
#         Depending on whether the number of elements under consideration
#         is even or odd, to find the median we either select the center
#         element from the list or average the two elements either side of
#         the center. In this simplest case of an arithmetic mean we add
#         the two values and divide by 2.
# 
#         Then, depending on whether the left and right Ñ equal Ñ sides
#         around the median have an even or odd count we need to again
#         select either a discrete center element or average the two
#         surrounding.
# 
#         Because again there oddly is no rigorous consistency in defining
#         the calculation of the 1st and 3rd quartiles, and these differing
#         approaches result in differing outcomes, we will need to pick
#         one. We will use the common method of halving the array if the
#         median point lies between two values, and if the median is a
#         discreet element not including it in the half-array length.
# 
#         We are left with four cases to evaluate, for each of the four
#         combinations of even and odd numbers of data points in both the
#         full dataset and our chosen determined half-size.
# 
#         I still find it exceedingly odd that the method for determining
#         the 25% and 75% medians, if you will, are not well-defined.
#         However in the statistical context of the summary, a closer look
#         suggests an essentially parallel ambiguity in what we want from
#         our middle value. So in a weird way the ambiguity is consistent.
# 
#         After all, the statistics are based on the median, not the mean.
