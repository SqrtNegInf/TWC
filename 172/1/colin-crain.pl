#       Prime Partition
#         Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
#         You are given two positive integers, $m and $n.
# 
#         Write a script to find out the Prime Partition of the given number.
#         No duplicates allowed.
# 
#         For example,
# 
#             Input: $m = 18, $n = 2
#             Output: 5, 13 or 7, 11
#     
#             Input: $m = 19, $n = 3
#             Output: 3, 5, 11

#         method:
# 
#         A decidedly non trivial problem for a first task this week!
# 
#         Prime partitioning is a decidely complex math problem, and it
#         seems the only easily-managed, albeit computationallyexpensive
#         solution is to investigate all patterns of or the list of primes
#         smaller than the target number to see whether they can be summed
#         to resolve correctly.
# 
#         As the resulting lists will be of largely-unknownn and of variable
#         lengths, a recursive solution is warranted. A prime is
#         added to a partial list, a partial sum is accumulated, and then
#         the partial pattern and sum are handed to the routine again, this
#         time searching for a new target properly reduced by the prime
#         that was added.
