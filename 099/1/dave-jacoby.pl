    # a comment from Jonas Berlin (xkr47) 
    # made me reconsider. By the rules of the
    # task, ? is ONE character and * is MANY 
    # CHARACTERS, but in Perl's regular 
    # expressions, .? is ZERO OR ONE CHARACTER
    # and .* is ZERO OR MORE CHARACTERS
    # to get ONE OR MORE CHARACTERS, we instead
    # use .+ and to get ONE CHARACTER, we use .
    # 
    # but of course, we need to match the WHOLE
    # string, so we're matching the beginning (^)
    # and the end ($)
