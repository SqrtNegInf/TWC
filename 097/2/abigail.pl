# of a section.
#
# (We'll just split into substring, and then ignore them, just to
#  satisfy the condition).
#
# To calculate the minimum number of flips, for each position $i, we
# calculate the number of 0s there are on the $i-th positions of
# each section. Given the number of 0s, we can calculate the number
# of 1s. The minimum number of flips required to get all the bits
# on position equal is the minimum of the number of 0s and the number
# of 1s.
#
# So, to calculate the minimum number of flips, for each postion,
# we sum the minimum of the number of 0s and the number of 1s.
