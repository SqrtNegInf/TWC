# ch-2.pl Perl Weekly Challenge 269 Task 2 Distribute Elements
#=============================================================================
# You are given an array of distinct integers, @ints.
# Write a script to distribute the elements as described below:
# 1) Put the 1st element of the given array to a new array @arr1.
# 2) Put the 2nd element of the given array to a new array @arr2.
# Once you have one element in each arrays, @arr1 and @arr2,
# then follow the rule below:
#
# If the last element of the array @arr1 is greater than the last
# element of the array @arr2, then add the first element of the
# given array to @arr1 otherwise to the array @arr2.
# 
# When done distribution, return the concatenated arrays. @arr1 and @arr2.
#
# Example 1 Input: @ints = (2, 1, 3, 4, 5)
#           Output: (2, 3, 4, 5, 1)
#   1st operation: Add 1 to @arr1 = (2)
#   2nd operation: Add 2 to @arr2 = (1)
#   3rd operation: last element of @arr1 > the last element of @arr2,
#                  add 3 to @arr1 = (2, 3).
#   4th operation: last element of @arr1 > the last element of @arr2,
#                  add 4 to @arr1 = (2, 3, 4)
#   5th operation: Finally, the last element of @arr1 is again greater
#   than the last element of @arr2, add 5 to @arr1 = (2, 3, 4, 5)
#   Mow we have two arrays: @arr1 = (2, 3, 4, 5), @arr2 = (1)
#   Concatenate the two arrays and return the final array: (2, 3, 4, 5, 1).
#
# Example 2 Input: @ints = (3, 2, 4)
#           Output: (3, 4, 2)
#   1st operation: Add 1 to @arr1 = (3)
#   2nd operation: Add 2 to @arr2 = (2)
#   3rd operation: , add 4 to @arr1 = (3, 4).
#   Mow we have two arrays: @arr1 = (3, 4) @arr2 = (2)
#   Concatenate the two arrays and return the final array: (3, 4, 2).
#
# Example 3 Input: @ints = (5, 4, 3 ,8)
#           Output: (5, 3, 4, 8)
#   1st operation: Add 1 to @arr1 = (5)
#   2nd operation: Add 2 to @arr2 = (4)
#   3rd operation: add 3 to @arr1 = (5, 3).
#   4th operation: add 8 to @arr2 = (4, 8)
#   Now we have two arrays: @arr1 = (5, 3) @arr2 = (4, 8)
#   Concatenate the two arrays and return the final array: (5, 3, 4, 8).
