# First note that due to symmetry, there cannot be a unique solution [1].
# If
#
#      (a, b, c, d, e, f, g) = (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6, x_7)
#
# is a solution, then
#
#      (a, b, c, d, e, f, g) = (x_7, x_6, x_5, x_4, x_3, x_2, x_1)
#
# must be a solution as well.
#
# For instance, the given example has 8 solutions, 4 of which are
# mirror images.
#
# [1] This assumes no duplicate numbers in the input. Clearly, a
#     solution where a == g, b == f, and c == e doesn't give a
#     different solution when mirrorred. (For instance, if all 
#     numbers are 0, there is only one solution).

#
#
# It's easy to brute force this. There are a mere 5040 permutations
# of the seven numbers; it would be hard to find an environment
# where it takes more than a few milliseconds to try all permutations.
#
# We can improve the brute force a little, by determining early we're
# on a wrong path. For instance, once we have picked an a, b, c, and d,
# we can check whether a + b == b + c + d. If not, we don't have to
# continue trying values for e, f, and g.
#
# However, that's not the way we go. We will first do some analysis.
# Let the sum of each box be N. Then we have:
#
#   N = a + b        (1)
#   N = b + c + d    (2)
#   N = d + e + f    (3)
#   N = f + g        (4)
#
# For (1) and (2), we get:
#
#   a + b = b + c + d  =>
#   a     =     c + d  =>
#   a - c =         d
#
# In the same way, (3) and (4), we get:
#
#   g + f = f + e + d  =>
#   g     =     e + d  =>
#   g - e =         d
#
# This leads to the following algorithm:
# 
#   - Calculate the differences between all pairs (7 * 6 == 42 pairs)
#   - Find all numbers n from the input array for which there are at
#     least two pairs giving this difference, under the condition n
#     is not part of such a pair. (Note that if the input contains
#     two or more of the same number, for this purpose, we treat those
#     numbers to be different). These numbers will be our candidate for d.
#   - Of the list of differences equalling d, consider each pair.
#     Eliminate pairs where the same number appears in each. The first
#     difference gives candidates for a and c; the second gives candidates
#     for g and e. (Swapping them leaves to a symmetric solution).
#   - We now have candidates for a, c, d, e, and g. This leaves two
#     numbers for b and c.
#   - Try both, and check whether a + b == b + c + d == d + e + f == f + g.
#
# For the given example, this means we only try 32 permutations,
# giving us 4 different solutions (the other 4 can be found by
# reversing the numbers).
#
# We are not making any assumptions on the sign of the input numbers;
# our algorithm works fine if the input contains negative numbers.
#
# We will also print all solutions (including the symmetric ones)
