## We will quickly run benchmarking...
## This suggests the for loop to be approximately 40%
## faster than the map solution...
## It is also 9 characters shorter...

##
##        Rate  Map  For
## Map 59524/s   -- -26%
## For 79936/s  34%   --

## First attempt - the one-liner is to write this as a map,
## we add $t at the end which is the value returned

  ## This time we won't write this as a nasty map/reduce solution...
  ##
  ## Just a for loop;
  ##
  ## Notes:
  ##  * To allow for an "unless" in a postfix loop, we rewrite this
  ##    by noting:
  ##      unless( $condition ) { fun(); }
  ##    can be rewritten as:
  ##      ($condition)||($fun())
  ##  * in perl `foreach` and `for` are synonymous - so we can shorten
  ## Finally a quick "shortening" - if there is no specific return
  ## statement - we can just omit the return in the last statement...
