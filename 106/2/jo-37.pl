}

# Convert a fraction into its decimal representation, highlighting a
# repetend.
#
# We *could* perform a long division, record the occurring remainders
# after the numerator has been exhausted and stop at the first
# repetition.  But...
#
# Here is a different plan:
# Perform a BigRat division with a sufficient number of significant
# digits.  Then truncate the result at the end of a repetend and find
# the true repetend.  The required number of digits is composed of the
# integer part's length, the length of a non-repeating sequence and an
# estimate for the period, i.e. a (preferably small) multiple of it.
# The integer part is facile.
# For the length of the non-repeating sequence we have to find the
# powers of 2 and 5 in the denominator.  Each factor 2, 5 or 10 adds
# one digit.  Thus the length of the non-repeating sequence is the
# maximum exponent of 2 and 5 in the denominator.
# For an estimate of the period we need to find the largest divisor in
# the denominator that is coprime to 10, i.e. the denominator with all
# powers of the common factors removed.
# The period of the reciprocal of the coprime denominator cannot be
# larger than the maximum order of this reduced denominator as an
# element of the multiplicative group of integers modulo k (for any
# coprime k), which is given by Carmichael's lambda function.
# See
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeating_decimal#Reciprocals_of_composite_integers_coprime_to_10
# and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmichael_function
# Luckily the lambda function is provided by the awesome
# Math::Prime::Util module.
# Finally, put the actual repetend in parentheses.
