#
# To determine the repeating digits of a fraction, it's very tempting
# to use sprintf with a large amount of digits, and see what repeats.
# But Perl isn't precise enough even for small numbers to do so.
#
# For instance, 1/29 is 
#     .(0344827586206896551724137931)
#
# But sprintf "%.60f" => 1/29 gives:
#     0.034482758620689655171595968188857916914002998964861035346985
#
# Not only does it go wrong after 20 digits, there's no repetition.
# Furthermore, if we increase the precision, we find that all decimals
# after the 70th, are 0.
#

#
# We're creation the decimal expansion of the fraction $N / $D
# by performing long division. 
#
# First, we calculate the part before the decimal point, by
# doing integer division of $N / $D.
# We're then left to do division of $N' / $D, where $N' initially
# is $N % $D.
# We then repeatedly find new digits by calculating the integer
# division of (10 * $N' / $D) (which gives us a new digit in the
# decimal expansion), and then setting $N' = 10 * $N' % $D.
# The fraction will have a finite decimal expansion if during the
# process $N' becomes 0. Otherwise, it repeats, and it repeats
# as soon as have a $N' which we've already seen.
# To calculate the repeating part, we keep track of how far we
# were in calculating the expansion for which $N'.
