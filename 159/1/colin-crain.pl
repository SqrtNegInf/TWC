#         Farey Sequence
#         Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
#         You are given a positive number, $n.
# 
#         Write a script to compute Farey Sequence of the order $n.
# 
#         Example 1:
#             Input: $n = 5
#             Output: 0/1, 1/5, 1/4, 1/3, 2/5, 
#                     1/2, 
#                     3/5, 2/3, 3/4, 4/5, 1/1
# 
#         Example 2:
#             Input: $n = 7
#             Output: 0/1, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 2/7, 1/3, 2/5, 3/7, 
#                     1/2, 
#                     4/7, 3/5, 2/3, 5/7, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 6/7, 1/1
# 
#         Example 3:
#             Input: $n = 4
#             Output: 0/1, 1/4, 1/3, 
#                     1/2, 
#                     2/3, 3/4, 1/1
# 
#         method:
# 
#             The Fahey sequence or a given order n is a list of all
#             subunary fractions with denominators up to the value of the
#             order, reduced to their lowest terms and placed in ascending
#             order. One interesting property of this sequence is that for
#             any triplet of successive terms selected, the central term
#             will be the mediant of the two outer, which is to say we can
#             obtain the ratio of the intermediate value by summing the two
#             numerators and two denominators of the outside terms: for the
#             two terms in example 2 above 2/7 and 2/5 the intermediate
#             numerator is 2+2 and denominator is 7+5, yielding 4/12, wich
#             can be reduced to 1/3. This can be seen to be the case by
#             examination of the example.
# 
#             Two algorithms suggest themselves to produce the Fahey
#             sequence for a given order: we can either construct all the
#             fractions exhaustively, reduce them to their lowest terms,
#             remove duplicates and sort them; or alternately we can bisect
#             each set of adjacent fractions in the the previous order to
#             construct the next, reducing them as possible along the way,
#             until we arrive at the order requested.
