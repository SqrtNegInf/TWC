Task #1: Total Zero

    You are given two positive integers C<$x> and C<$y>.

    Write a script to find out the number of operations needed to make both
    C<ZERO>. Each operation is made up either of the followings:

=begin code
    $x = $x - $y if $x >= $y

    or

    $y = $y - $x if $y >= $x (using the original value of $x)
=end code
