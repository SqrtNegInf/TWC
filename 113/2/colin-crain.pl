#         Recreate Binary Tree
#         Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
#         You are given a Binary Tree.
# 
#         Write a script to replace each node of the tree with the sum of all
#         the remaining nodes.
# 
#         Example
#         
#             Input Binary Tree
#                     1
#                    / \
#                   2   3
#                  /   / \
#                 4   5   6
#                  \
#                   7
#  
#             Output Binary Tree
#                     27
#                    /  \
#                   26  25
#                  /   /  \
#                 24  23  22
#                  \
#                  21

#         method:
#             I have nothing against binary trees, or really any kinds of trees,
#             arboreal or conceptual. I like trees. They give me pleasure to
#             watch, shade to cool me, and provide the stuff I like to breathe:
#             day in, day out, all of this for free without a complaint to be
#             heard. I can't say they never hurt anyone, but I do think it
#             highly unlikely they ever did so on purpose. It might be more fair
#             to blame gravity for that falling branch than the poor being that
#             lost its appendage. Or the ground the hiker was standing on, for
#             that matter, for the sudden stop. The ground is very dangerous
#             stuff. Every year, almost every accident that happens happens on
#             the ground. Someone should look into this. 

#             That said, I am not that fond of working with binary trees in
#             these challenges. It's not the trees themselves; writing methods
#             to do clever stuff is great and all. What bugs me is the I/O
#             portion. There's no really good satisfactory way to encode a tree
#             for easy transport. They generally end up a jumble of brackets
#             that you pray hasn't been corrupted. They aren't hard to work
#             with, they're hard for humans to read and write.
# 
#             The data is input as a serialized tree in an array. In this format
#             each position of a theoretical full tree in a breadth-first
#             traversal is assigned a sequential element in an array, whether it
#             contains a node or not. Thus the root layer is a single element at
#             index [0], the next layer two indices at [1] and [2], the next
#             [3],[4],[5] and [6], etc. Empty nodes, as we said, leave holes in
#             the sequence filled with `undef`. Because things are complicated
#             enough the data is directly written in to the script as an
#             existing Perl array. 
# 
#             One primary advantage of this format is that the parent and child
#             nodes maintain a clearly defined relationship, with the children
#             for a given node at index [n] occupying indices [2n+1] and [2n+2].
# 
#             I decided to write up a proper set of classes to hold the data
#             structure this time. The data structure is read in recursively
#             through the parent-child relationship, but after that the nodes
#             like to themselves through "left" and "right" attriubutes.
# 
#             Two routines descend the trees from the root node, one to add the
#             value of each node to a `sum` attribute, the second to travese
#             again and replace the value of each nod to the summed value minus
#             that value, being the sum of all the other values in the tree.
# 
#             To print the tree I brought out the pretty print routine from PWC
#             057 and updated it. This operates on serialized data, so a serial
#             dump routine was fashioned to mirror the load routine. I cleaned
#             it up and worked it over some more, so among other things now it
#             uses Unicode box-drawing characters, giving it a sleek new art
#             deco look.
