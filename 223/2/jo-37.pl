### Implementation

# This is more a guess than a solution.
# Some thoughts leading to this procedure:
# - The largest impact on the collected points comes from the product of
#   the  three largest numbers.  Thus removing elements until the three
#   largest number are left over.
# - Selecting a small number, though contributing little, may increase
#   the available products in the next step.  Thus selecting elements in
#   ascending order.
# - Selecting the smallest number providing the largest product is
#   required for consecutive minima and does not hurt otherwise.
# - When only three elements are left, the middle needs to be selected
#   to take advantage of the largest product.
#
# I'm curious about the comparison between this procedure's results with
# exact solutions.
