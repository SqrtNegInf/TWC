Task 2: Reversible Numbers  Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar

Find  all Reversible Numbers below 100.

An integer is reversible if the sum of the number and its
textual reverse has only odd digits.  Single digit
integers are deemed not reversible.

36 is reversible as 36 + 63 = 99 i.e. all digits are odd.
17 is not reversible as 17 + 71 = 88, not all are odd.
