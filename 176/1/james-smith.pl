## Now we will use a 2nd approach - this uses the fact
## that for long primes the multiples all contain the
## same digits - if you including leading zeros.
##
## We can ignore the leading zeros and start with numbers
## beginning in 1
##
## We use the long prime code from challenge 139 to work
## out which are the long primes, and this gives us a
## single exemplar for the rotation. We then re-order this
## to get the numbers which start with 1 and when multiplied
## by 6 have the same length.
##
## In this case they start with a "1" and are less than
## "1" followed by p-2 "6"s - faster as we don't need to
## big ints...
