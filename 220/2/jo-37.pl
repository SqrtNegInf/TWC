### Implementation

# Before analyzing some solution approaches, let us consider two edge
# cases:
# A) @ints = (1, 8, 17, 32, 49, 72,...), see https://oeis.org/A077221
#    This array has two solutions (one forward and one backward) and it
#    has k! permutations.
# B) @ints = (2, 2, 2, 2,...)
#    This array has one solution (just itself) and it has one single
#    multi-permutation.
#
# A straightforward implementation would loop over all
# multi-permutations of the given list and record the squareful
# hits.  For case A) this would be k! loops to find two solutions -
# which is very inefficient.  In case B) there is a single loop
# revealing the single solution.
#
# A second thought: The list elements may be regarded as the vertices of
# an undirected graph.  Each vertex has a unique id and a value.
# Two vertices are connected by an edge if the sum of their values
# is a perfect square.  Then enumerate all Hamiltonian paths in the
# resulting graph.  Finding the two Hamiltonian paths in case A)
# should be easy.  However in case B) this approach would find k!
# Hamiltonian paths that are all identical within the scope of this
# task.
#
# Finally:
# Trying to merge the ideas behind the previous approaches.
# - Generate an "adjacency matrix" that defines the possible successors
#   of a given value.
# - Generate an availability counter for each unique value in the list.
# - Loop over all unique values from the list as the root node of a
#   "virtual tree".
# - Perform a depth-first search in each virtual tree.  Child nodes are
#   values that are both possible successors and have a positive
#   availability count.  At each leaf node having a depth equal to the
#   size of the list, record the path from the root node.
#
#  Case A) will loop over all k values as the root node.  All the
#  virtual trees are linear paths with only two of them reaching the
#  maximum depth.
#  Case B) consists of one single linear path.
