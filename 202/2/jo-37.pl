### Implementation

# Find the leftmost widest valley in a single pass through the list.
# This can be achieved by tracking every valley, identified by its
# starting index, length (in data points, not steps!) and current
# direction.  A valley at the end of its uphill slope is considered
# "closed" and is marked with a zero direction.
#
sub widest_valley {
    # Start with one valley consisting of a single point downhill slope.
    # This enables a starting uphill half-valley.
    my  @valleys = ({start => 0, length => 1, dir => -1});

        # non-ascending step.
