#       Weird Number
#         Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
#         You are given number, $n > 0.
# 
#         Write a script to find out if the given number is a Weird Number.
# 
#         According to Wikipedia, it is defined as:
# 
#         The sum of the proper divisors (divisors including 1 but not itself) of the
#         number is greater than the number, but no subset of those divisors sums to
#         the number itself.
# 
#         Example 1:
#             Input: $n = 12
#             Output: 0
# 
#         Since the proper divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, which sum to 16; but
#         2 + 4 + 6 = 12.
# 
#         Example 2:
#             Input: $n = 70
#             Output: 1
# 
#         As the proper divisors of 70 are 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, and 35; these sum to
#         74, but no subset of these sums to 70.
# 
#         analysis:
# 
#             If weird numbers were common, I suppose the reasoning is,
#             then they wouldn't be very weird, now would they? Well
#             frankly my own life experience directly and daily contradicts
#             this by inspection. Maybe other people's lives are boring and
#             uneventful, but I wouldn't know — and don't have any reason
#             to believe the weird stops at my door.
# 
#             The world, I like to say, is not only weirder than you
#             imagine, but is weirder than you can imagine.
# 
#             A number that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors is
#             known as a perfect number. A number that can be formed from a
#             subset of its proper divisors is not-quite perfect, and is
#             known as a semiperfect number.
# 
#             A number whose proper divisors add to a sum greater than the
#             original number is known as an abundant number. Putting this
#             together it follows that semiperfect numbers are abundant, as
#             there must be some factor left over from constructing the
#             qualifying subset that makes a number semiperfect instead of
#             perfect.
# 
#             The weird numbers are abundant, meaning there are enough
#             factors to sum to the number, but also no combination of
#             those factors can be assembled to do the job, and so are not
#             semiperfect.
# 
#             This combination is rather unusual, to say the least.
