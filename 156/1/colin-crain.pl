#       Pernicious Numbers
#         Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
#         Write a script to permute first 10 Pernicious Numbers.
# 
#         A pernicious number is a positive integer which has prime number
#         of ones in its binary representation.
# 
#         The first pernicious number is 3 since binary representation of 3
#         = (11) and 1 + 1 = 2, which is a prime.
# 
#         Expected Output
#         3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
# 
#         Analysis
# 
#             Pernicious numbers are a product of the dark side of number
#             theory, or as I call it, dark number theory. And yes that is
#             a totally real thing I didn't just make up.
# 
#             In dark number theory half the numbers are plain evil. And
#             the numbers that are not evil are mearly odious. Numbers are
#             wicked, and in groups — angry mobs set in action, descending
#             on the castle — they can be monsterous. 
# 
#             The evil numbers have an even popcount, or binary Hamming
#             index, the odious the complementary odd fraction, and
#             therefore all positive numbers are either evil or odious. The
#             pernicious numbers have a prime Hamming weight, which makes
#             pernicious numbers to be generally, but not exclusively
#             odious, although some can still be said to be outright evil.
# 
#             The relative distribution between evil and odiousness in
#             numbers is quantified by their perfidy. 

#             Some numbers, it seems, cannot be trusted. 13, for example,
#             is obviously on the dark side, and perniciously odious; this is
#             so obvious that 1313 Mockingbird Place was the fictional
#             address fo the Munster's home, a television family of literal
#             monsters. "13.13" is also the name of a record release by the musician
#             Lydia Lunch. This recording is well produced, full of
#             wailing, dismal lyrics atop a psychedelic, even Beatlesque
#             sonic backdrop, but apparently the animosity between Lunch
#             and her backing band, members the LA punk group the Weirdos,
#             was so great that she chose to allow the work to languish and
#             refused to press more copies past the first run for literally
#             decades.
# 
#             Whole lot of evil going on there.  Hail Satan, Lydia.
# 
#             Oh, and now that we've brought up that particular being, in
#             the OEIS the sequence A051003, numbers containing the
#             digit-sequence 666, are known as the hateful numbers, and
#             furthermore numbers with 666 digits represent the apocalypes
#             numbers. I will now make a conjecture that for every person
#             who has existed and will exist throughout history, somewhere
#             there is a unique apocalypse number with their name on it.
# 
#             How's that for representing the dark side?
# 
#         Method
# 
#             To find the pernicious numbers we will need some sort of
#             popcount function to count the population of 1s in a binary
#             representation. We first visited this idea in PWC 114,
#             Integer Set Bits.
