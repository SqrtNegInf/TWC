#`{
- Take single positional Positional argument, @^matrix
- Take the minimum of each row -- `>>.min` is like `.map(&min)` here
    - `>>` !== `map` in general though: https://www.reddit.com/r/rakulang/comments/zg4rrq/comment/izgrvt3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3
- Take the maximum of each column
    - We first "transpose" the ArrayOfArrays with self-zipping
    - Then take each now-rows' maximal values
- Intersection of row-minimals and column-maximals is the result
    - `∩` is the intersection operator (`(&)` in ASCII); operands need not be Setty
    - The result is a Set -- we need its first (and perhaps the only) element
    - We reach the first one via `.head`
    - But since Sets are Maps in disguise with values being `True`, we need a `.key` further
- If no such intersection exists, we got `Nil`, so `//` (defined-or) will route to -1
