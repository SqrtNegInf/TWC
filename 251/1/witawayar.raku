#`{
- Take an array of things via the implicit signature @^ints
- Zip that array with its reversed version
    - This essentially takes 1 item from beginning and 1 from end together
- We don't need the "repeated" zippings, i.e., past the middle point, it will be mirrored
    - So take until the half of the array via `^(* div 2)` (`*` is passed the array length)
- We are zipping with `~`, i.e., string gluer, so the numbers will be joined together
    - Summation of those glueds will be the end result, except...
- If we had an odd-sized array, the middle guy didn't get accounted for, so we add that
