#       Fortunate Numbers
#         Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
#         Write a script to produce first 8 Fortunate Numbers (unique and
#         sorted).
# 
#         According to Wikipedia
# 
#         A Fortunate number, named after Reo Fortune, is the smallest
#         integer m > 1 such that, for a given positive integer n, pn# + m
#         is a prime number, where the primorial pn# is the product of the
#         first n prime numbers.
# 
#         Expected Output
# 
#           3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 23, 37

#         analysis
# 
#             We recently had a discussion on the squarefree numbers, and
#             how they pop up unexpectedly all over topics in numbet
#             theory. I will take the time to notice that the product of
#             the first n prime numbers is the same as a prime degeneration
#             with a maximal amount of discrete factors, with no exponents.
#             So in other words we are talking about the largest squarefree
#             number that we can create from n number of factors.
# 
#             Sow how about that?
# 
#             To rephrase the description then, the fortunate numbers
#             correspond to a list of positive deltas required to make the
#             largest squarefree number with that many factors prime.
# 
#             So we need to produce a list of primes, and from that list of
#             cumulative products as we multiply in each successive term.
#             Then from each of these products we need to first add 3 to
#             make it odd and check for primality.
# 
#             Because the promorial will always be have 2 as a factor it
#             will always be even. We would make this odd by adding 1, but
#             1 is always excluded from the fortunate numbers so we
#             immediately jump to 3.
# 
#             Likewise for testing a number for primality we can skip the
#             calculation for 2, because we know we've made the candidate
#             odd already. So we can start at 3 and increment upwards by 2s
#             from there. We test repeatedly until we are prime.
# 
#             There's one last step though, which is to find 8 distinct
#             terms and sort them. We'll need to gather terms until we have
#             enough. As it's evident the list is not necessarily ordered,
#             this raises the possibility that somewhere along the line the
#             value 11 may arise, say at position 1142 or such. I don't see
#             that happening but at the moment I don't see any reason to
#             exclude the possiblity.
# 
#             What we will do though is assume it will not, and interpret
#             the directive as "the first 8 distinct terms, sorted", which
#             is slightly different and less absolute. We will collect
#             terms until we find 8 values and then dump the buffer.
