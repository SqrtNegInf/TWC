-examples
    run the examples from the challenge

    print final internal data structures

-size=N
    generate a random NxN distance matrix

-max=M
    use M as the maximum distance when generating a random matrix
    Default: 10

-benchmark
    run a benchmark comparing the Held-Karp implementation and a brute
    force trial

-perm
    use a brute force implementation instead of the Held-Karp algorithm

d11,d12,...,d1N ... dN1,dN2,...dNN
    build the distance matrix from the elements dij where columns are
    numerical values separated by comma and/or optional space and rows are
    the arguments to $0.

    The example may be specified as:
    $0 0,5,2,7 5,0,5,3 3,1,0,6 4,5,4,0
    or (combining some row formats):
    $0 '0  5  2  7' '5, 0, 5, 3' '3 1 0 6' 4,5,4,0

### Implementation

# Solving the asymmetric travelling salesman problem (aTSP) using the
# Held-Karp algorithm, see
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Held-Karp_algorithm.
# This algorithm provides an exact solution and becomes faster than a
# brute-force scan of all permutations for matrix sizes above 6x6.  The
# price is a rather high memory consumption.  This implementation is
# capable of solving an aTSP with a size of 20 in less than one minute
# but needs more than 1 GB of memory for this task.  Using GNU "time"
# instead of the shell builtin reports for -size=20:
#   42.48user 0.46system 0:43.01elapsed 99%CPU
#   (0avgtext+0avgdata 1236032maxresident)k
# 
# Cities are identified by a zero-based index.  The tour starts and ends
# in 0.
