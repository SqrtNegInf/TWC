#  DESCRIPTION: Travelling Salesman Problem
#               Outputs a naive (fast) solution which is good but will
#               not necessarily produce the shortest route.
#               Also outputs a brute-force (slow) solution which does
#               produce the shortest route.
#
#      OPTIONS: Specify num_cities for an additional random network of
#               that many nodes.
# REQUIREMENTS: Time::HiRes, Math::Combinatorics
#        NOTES: Takes 40s to run brute force with num_cities = 11.
