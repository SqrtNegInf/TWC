# TASK #2 › The Travelling Salesman
# Submitted by: Jorg Sommrey
# You are given a NxN matrix containing the distances between N cities.
#
# Write a script to find a round trip of minimum length visiting all N cities
# exactly once and returning to the start.
#
# Example
# Matrix: [0, 5, 2, 7]
#         [5, 0, 5, 3]
#         [3, 1, 0, 6]
#         [4, 5, 4, 0]
#
# Output:
#         length = 10
#         tour = (0 2 1 3 0)
