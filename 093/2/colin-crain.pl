#       TASK #2 › Sum Path
#         Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
#         You are given binary tree containing numbers 0-9 only.
#
#         Write a script to sum all possible paths from root to leaf.
#
#         Example 1:
#
#             Input:
#                  1
#                 /
#                2
#               / \
#              3   4
#
#             Output: 13
#             as sum two paths (1->2->3) and (1->2->4)
#
#         Example 2:
#
#             Input:
#                  1
#                 / \
#                2   3
#               /   / \
#              4   5   6
#
#             Output: 26
#             as sum three paths (1->2->4), (1->3->5) and (1->3->6)

#         method:
#             one of the most bothersome aspects of binary tree algorithms isn't
#             the manipultion of the tree itself, but rather inputting the data
#             into a program in the first place. One way to accomplish this is
#             to serialize the data, considering the tree as an array of levels,
#             each level containing 2 times the elements of the level previous,
#             with a starting index after the end of the previous level. Empty
#             nodes are still allocated space in the indexing to preserve
#             pattern continuity. Here null-set nodes are allocated undef.

#             Because the levels are of known, calcuable size, any node in the
#             tree can be directly addressed with a simple formula. The
#             serialized transform remains a binary tree, with any action on the
#             familiar form available to the latter, with a suitable transform
#             applied to the function.

#             The numbering of the indices follows a strict formal progression.
#             Each level starts at the index 2^n - 1, with n being the level of
#             the tree, starting at 0.
#
#                                    0
#                         1                     2
#                    3         4           5         6
#                 7     8   9    10     11    12  13   14

#             Not displayed here, the next level of the tree would be level 4,
#             comprised of 2^4 positions, and starting at index 2^4 - 1. A quick
#             visual inspection confirms this.

#             Knowing the encoding, we can directly address individual nodes by
#             their position in the array. For a given index n, the children, if
#             any, for that index will be located at the positions 2n+1 and
#             2n+2. To find the parent, if the index is even, subtract 1, if
#             odd, 2, then divide the result by 2.

#             We can easily set up a recursive routine to trace paths descending
#             through every node of the tree, with a base case summing the path
#             to the terminus and adding that total to the overall sum.

#             As a bonus, we'll gather the completed paths at the termination
#             case and report on those paths found at the end.
