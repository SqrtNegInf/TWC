#         TASK #1 â€º Max Points
#         Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
#         You are given set of co-ordinates @N.
#
#         Write a script to count maximum points on a straight line when given
#         co-ordinates plotted on 2-d plane.
#
#         Example 1:
#         |
#         |     x
#         |   x
#         | x
#         + _ _ _ _
#
#         Input: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3)
#         Output: 3
#         Example 2:
#         |
#         |
#         | x       x
#         |   x
#         | x   x
#         + _ _ _ _ _
#
#         Input: (1,1), (2,2), (3,1), (1,3), (5,3)
#         Output: 3

#         method:
#             Two points determine a line. Thus between every two points given a
#             line segment can be scribed, which can be extended infinitely in
#             both directions to determine the line it falls on. Our task is to
#             see how many of these infinite lines overlap, and are in fact the
#             same line.

#             At it's heart this is a problem of combinatorics, of combinations
#             of two points. A single point can be determined to either fall or
#             not on a given line, but we first need a line to check, and the
#             only way to find those is to look at pairs of points.

#             In fact, if we're going to look at every pair anyways, we already
#             have all the information we need to derive a solution. For every
#             pair, use those points to determine a line segment AB with
#             endpoints (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). This segment will fall on exactly
#             one infinite line of the form y = mx + b, with m being the slope
#             of the line and b an offset on the y-axis.

#             To calculate the slope and constant of the through line from the
#             pairs of points we calculate the delta for the ys over the delta
#             for the xs. The offset will be the same for both points, so we can
#             use either to calculate b:
#
#             m = (y2-y1) / (x2-x1)
#
#             b = y1 - m * x1

#             Once we have a pair of coefficiants (m,b), these can be turned
#             into a unique hash key. Unfortuantely this is complicated by the
#             limitations of floating point arithmetic over the value of the
#             slope, so we'll devise a purpose-built stringification routine to
#             ensure equivalent slopes get the same hash key. It doesn't matter
#             what the key actually is, only that it be a unique mapping.
