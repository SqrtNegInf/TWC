# There are two things to consider for this challenge:
# efficiency and accuracy.
#
# Effiency
# --------
#
# We could take all pairs of points, draw the line through them, and
# check how many of the other points lie on that line, and find the
# line with the most points on them.
#
# But this leads to a cubic algorithm.
#
# Observation:
#     If we have three points p_i, p_j, p_k, and the slope of the line
#     through p_i and p_j is the same as the slope of the line between
#     p_i and p_k then p_i, p_j, and p_k are colinear. Ergo, all points
#     p_l, i <> l, for which the line through p_i and p_l has the same
#     slope are colinear (and p_i is colinear with them as well).
#     And the reverse holds as well.
# 
# So, for each point p_i, we look at each point p_j, (i < j), and
# we calculate the slope the line through the two points make. For
# each slope calculated, we count how often it was calculated; adding 1
# to this value gives us the number of colinear points for a line with
# that slope which passes through p_i. It's then a matter of finding
# the maximum over all slopes, and all points.
#
# This leads to a quadractic solution, as we consider each pair of 
# points once.
#
#
# Accurancy
# ---------
#
# The algorithm involves calculating and comparing slopes. But slopes
# are ratios between numbers, and ratios have the tendency to not be
# integers. Computers are bad at comparing non-integers, due to rounding.
#
# To combat that, we will assume the input numbers are decimal numbers;
# that is, we're accepting numbers like 1, -7, and 3.5789, but we're
# not accepting number like 2E7. If we have any numbers with a radix point
# (decimal numbers which aren't integers), we first add enough zeros
# so all numbers have the same number of digits after the radix point
# (for integers, we add a radix point, and a bunch of zeros). Then we
# we remove the radix point. In effect, we have multiplied all numbers by
# a power of 10 (the same power for all numbers), avoiding any arithmetic
# on non-integers (so we have avoided any rounding).
#
# Of course, the resulting integers may be too big to fit in 64-bit,
# but that's a trade off we are making.
#
# However, that doesn't mean the slopes we get are integers. All we
# have succeeded so far is that the slopes will be rational numbers:
# a ratio between two integers. But instead of the slope itself, we
# can just store the two numbers forming the ratio. However, a ratio
# doesn't not have a unique representation: 2/3 and 4/6 are the same
# ratio (aka slope), but have different representation.
#
# Therefore, if we calculate a slope as a ratio of two numbers, we
# divide the numbers by their GCD, so we have a unique representation.
#


#
# Calculate the GCD of two numbers.
