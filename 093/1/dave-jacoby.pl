# subsets and so on. a problem is that we use Algoritm::Permute
# which means for the set 1,2,3, we cover it six times, but
# it cleanly avoids all the headaches of putting together the
# subsets yourself, and is very fast.

# we test every subset, and if we fine a positive, that 
# means there is a line of this length, and then we go onto 
# the next length, because we don't care how many i-length
# lines there are; we just need one.
