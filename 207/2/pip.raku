# Task2: H-Index:  Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar;  You are given an array of integers containing citations a researcher has received for each paper.
#   Write a script to compute the researcher’s H-Index. For more information please checkout the wikipedia page.
#     The H-Index is the largest number h such that h articles have at least h citations each. For example, if an author has five publications, with 9, 7, 6,
#     2, and 1 citations (ordered from greatest to least), then the author’s h-index is 3, because the author has three publications with 3 or more citations.
#     However, the author does not have four publications with 4 or more citations.
# Example1:
#   In-put: @citations = (10,8,5,4,3)
#   Output: 4                         Because the 4th publication has 4 citations and the 5th has only 3.
# Example2:
#   In-put: @citations = (25,8,5,3,3)
#   Output: 3                         The H-Index is 3 because the fourth paper has only 3 citations.
# Last date to submit the solution 23:59 (UK Time) Sunday 12th March 2023.
