### Implementation

# The task states: "convert a given number (base 10)".  The kind of
# number is not specified.  As quater-imaginary numbers serve to
# represent complex numbers, here a complex number is expected.  In
# general this might be any complex number but for the sake of
# convenience only integer parts are converted into the quater-imaginary
# representation.  Unfortunately, these do not always map to "integer"
# quater-imaginary numbers because odd imaginary parts result in a
# broken place on the quater-imaginary side.  Therefore one broken place
# is allowed for the reverse conversion, too.
#
# Basic conversion algorithms:
#
# To quater-imaginary:
# - convert the real and half the imaginary part of a given complex
#   number to negaquaternary.  This gives one broken place for odd
#   imaginary parts.
# - interleave the negaquternary digits from both parts.
#
# From quater-imaginary:
# - split the digits at even and odd index positions into two parts.
# - convert both parts from negaquaternary to integer
# - double the imaginary part and construct a complex number from these
#   parts.
